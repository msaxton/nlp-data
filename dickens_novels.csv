Dickens,Tale,"There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the  throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with  a fair face, on the throne of France.

Dickens,Tale,"It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.  Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,  as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth  blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had  heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were  made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane  ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its  messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally  deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the  earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,  from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange  to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any  communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane  brood.",year lord thousand seven seventy spiritual revelation concede england favour period southcott recently attain twentieth bless birthday prophetic private life guards herald sublime appearance announce arrangement swallowing london westminster cock lane ghost lay round dozen year rap message spirit year past supernaturally deficient originality rap theirs mere message earthly order event lately come english crown people congress british subject america strange relate prove important human race communication receive chicken cock lane brood
Dickens,Tale,"France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her  sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down  hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her  Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane  achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue  torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not  kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks  which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty  yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and  Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,  already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into  boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in  it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses  of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were  sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with  rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which  the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of  the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work  unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about  with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion  that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.",france favour matter spiritual sister shield trident roll exceed smoothness hill make paper money spend guidance christian pastor entertain humane achievement sentence youth hand cut tongue tear pincer body burn alive kneel rain honour dirty procession monk pass view distance yard likely root wood france norway grow tree sufferer death mark woodman fate come sawn board certain movable framework sack knife terrible history likely rough outhouse tiller heavy land adjacent paris shelter weather day rude cart bespatter rustic mire snuff pig roost poultry farmer death set apart tumbril revolution woodman farmer work unceasingly work silently hear go muffled tread forasmuch entertain suspicion awake atheistical traitorous
Dickens,Tale,"In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to  justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and  highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;  families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing  their furniture to upholsterersâ warehouses for security; the highwayman  in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and  challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of  âthe Captain,â gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the  mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and  then got shot dead himself by the other four, âin consequence of the  failure of his ammunition:â after which the mail was robbed in peace;  that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand  and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the  illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London  gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law  fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;  thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at  Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Gilesâs, to search  for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the  musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences  much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy  and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing  up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on  Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the  hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of  Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,  and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmerâs boy of  sixpence.",england scarcely order protection justify national boasting dare burglary armed man highway robbery take place capital night family publicly caution town remove furniture warehouse security highwayman dark city tradesman light recognise challenge fellow tradesman stop character captain gallantly shoot head ride away mail waylay seven robber guard shoot dead get shoot dead consequence failure ammunition mail rob peace magnificent potentate lord mayor london stand deliver turnham green highwayman despoil illustrious creature sight retinue prisoner london gaol fight battle turnkey majesty law fire blunderbuss load round shot ball thief snip diamond crosse neck noble lord court drawing room musketeer go search contraband good mob fire musketeer musketeer fire mob think occurrence common way midst hangman busy bad useless constant requisition string long row miscellaneous criminal hang housebreaker saturday take tuesday burn people hand newgate dozen burn pamphlet door westminster hall day take life atrocious murderer morrow wretched pilferer rob boy sixpence
Dickens,Tale,"All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close  upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.  Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,  those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the  fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights  with a high hand.

Dickens,Tale,"  It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,  before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.  The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up  Shooterâs Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,  as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish  for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,  and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the  horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the  coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back  to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in  combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose  otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals  are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to  their duty.",dover road lay friday night late november person history business dover road lay dover mail lumber hill walk hill mire mail rest passenger relish walk exercise circumstance hill harness mud mail heavy horse time come stop draw coach road mutinous intent take blackheath rein whip coachman guard combination read article war forbid purpose strongly favour argument brute animal endue reason team capitulate return duty
Dickens,Tale,"With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through  the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were  falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested  them and brought them to a stand, with a wary âWo-ho! so-ho-then!â the  near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an  unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the  hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a  nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.",droop head tremulous tail mash way thick mud flounder stumble while fall piece large joint driver rest bring stand wary ho ho near leader violently shake head like unusually emphatic horse deny coach get hill leader rattle passenger start nervous passenger disturb mind
Dickens,Tale,"There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its  forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding  none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the  air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the  waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out  everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,  and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed  into it, as if they had made it all.",steaming mist hollow roam forlornness hill like evil spirit seek rest find clammy intensely cold mist slow way air ripple visibly follow overspread wave unwholesome sea dense shut light coach lamp working yard road reek labour horse steam
Dickens,Tale,"Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the  side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the  ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from  anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was  hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from  the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers  were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on  the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,  when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in  âthe Captainâsâ pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable  non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard  of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one  thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooterâs Hill, as  he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,  and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a  loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,  deposited on a substratum of cutlass.",passenger plod hill mail wrap cheekbone ear wear jack boot say see like hide wrapper eye mind eye body companion day traveller shy confidential short notice anybody road robber league robber posting house ale house produce somebody pay range landlord low stable non descript likeli thing card guard dover mail think friday night november thousand seven seventy lumber hill stand particular perch mail beat foot keep eye hand arm chest load blunderbuss lie loaded horse pistol deposit substratum cutlass
Dickens,Tale,"The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected  the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they  all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but  the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have  taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the  journey.",dover mail usual genial position guard suspect passenger passenger suspect guard suspect everybody coachman sure horse cattle clear conscience take oath testaments fit journey

Dickens,Tale,"The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,  made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed  suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its  passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach  stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three  had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead  into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of  getting shot instantly as a highwayman.",emphatic horse cut short whip decide negative decided scramble horse follow suit dover mail struggle jack boot passenger squash stop coach stop keep close company hardihood propose walk little ahead mist darkness fair way get shoot instantly highwayman

Dickens,Tale,"The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring  of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet  indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to  the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation.

For he was  furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown  and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut  himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,  and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in  five minutes.",coach lumber heavy wreath mist closing round begin descent guard soon replace blunderbuss arm chest have look rest content have look supplementary pistol wear belt look small chest beneath seat tool couple torch tinder box furnish completeness coach lamp blow storm occasionally happen shut inside flint steel spark straw light tolerable safety ease lucky minute

Dickens,Tale,"  A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is  constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A  solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every  one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every  room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating  heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of  its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the  awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I  turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time  to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable  water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses  of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the  book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read  but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an  eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood  in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,  my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable  consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that  individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my lifeâs end.

Then  the strong-rooms underground, at Tellsonâs, with such of their valuable  stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a  little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among  them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them  safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.",bank run mail bank passenger arm draw leathern strap lie pound passenger drive corner coach get special jolt nod place half shut eye little coach window coach lamp dimly gleam bulky bundle opposite passenger bank great stroke business rattle harness chink money draft honour minute foreign home connection pay thrice time strong room underground valuable store secret know passenger little know open go great key feebly burn candle find safe strong sound see

Pride, contempt,  defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;  so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands  and figures.

He had a good leg, and was a little vain  of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a  fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He  wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his  head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which  looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.  His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,  was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring  beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea.

The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling  wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was  destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and  brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong  a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be  dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little  fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by  night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide  made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,  sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable  that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.",lorry finish breakfast go stroll beach little narrow crooked town dover hide away beach run head chalk cliff like marine ostrich beach desert heap sea stone tumble wildly sea like like destruction thunder town thunder cliff bring coast madly air house strong piscatory flavour suppose sick fish go dip sick people go dip sea little fishing port quantity stroll night look seaward particularly time tide near flood small tradesman business unaccountably realise large fortune remarkable neighbourhood endure lamplighter

It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black  horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and  oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room  were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep  graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected  from them until they were dug out.",gentleman leave glass air stolid desperation settle odd little flaxen wig ear follow waiter miss apartment large dark room furnish funereal manner black horsehair load heavy dark table oil oil tall candle table middle room gloomily reflect leaf bury deep grave black mahogany light speak expect dig

As  his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden  hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and  a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth  it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was  not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright  fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his  eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,  of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very  Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran  high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of  the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital  procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were  offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the  feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.",obscurity difficult penetrate lorry pick way wear turkey carpet suppose miss manette moment adjacent room have get past tall candle see stand receive table fire young lady seventeen riding cloak hold straw travelling hat ribbon hand eye rest short slight pretty figure quantity golden hair pair blue eye meet inquire look forehead singular capacity remember young smooth rifte knit expression perplexity wonder alarm merely bright fix attention include expression eye rest thing sudden vivid likeness pass child hold arm passage channel cold time hail drift heavily sea run high likeness pass away like breath surface gaunt pier glass frame hospital procession negro cupid headless cripple offer black basket dead sea fruit black divinity feminine gender formal bow miss manette

Dickens,Tale,"  A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street.

Dickens,Tale,"All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their  idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular  stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have  thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,  had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own  jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,  made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help  women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all  run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in  the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with  handkerchiefs from womenâs heads, which were squeezed dry into infantsâ  mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;  others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and  there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new  directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed  pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted  fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the  wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up  along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,  if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous  presence.",people reach suspend business idleness run spot drink wine rough irregular stone street point way design think expressly lame living creature approach dam little pool surround jostling group crowd accord size man kneel scoop hand join sip try help woman bend shoulder sip wine run finger man woman dip puddle little mug mutilated earthenware handkerchief head squeeze dry mouth small mud embankment stem wine run direct looker high window dart cut little stream wine start away new direction devote sodden lee dye piece cask licking champ moister wine rot fragment eager relish drainage carry wine take mud get take scavenger street anybody acquaint believe miraculous presence
Dickens,Tale,"A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,  and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There  was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a  special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part  of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the  luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,  shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen  together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been  most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these  demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who  had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in  motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of  hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own  starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men  with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into  the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom  gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.",shrill sound laughter amuse voice voice man woman child resound street wine game last little roughness sport playfulness special companionship observable inclination join lead especially lucky light hearted frolicsome embrace drink health shake hand join hand dancing dozen wine go place abundant rake gridiron pattern finger demonstration cease suddenly break man leave saw stick firewood cut set motion woman leave door step little pot hot ashe try soften pain starve finger toe child return man bare arm matted lock cadaverous face emerge winter light cellar move away descend gloom gather scene appear natural sunshine
Dickens,Tale,"The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street  in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had  stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many  wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks  on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was  stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.  Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a  tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his  head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled  upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.",wine red wine stain ground narrow street suburb saint antoine paris spill stain hand face naked foot wooden shoe hand man saw wood leave red mark billet forehead woman nurse baby stain stain old rag wind head greedy stave cask acquire tigerish smear mouth tall joker besmirch head long squalid bag nightcap scrawl wall finger dip muddy wine lee blood

Dickens,Tale,"And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary  gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was  heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in  waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;  but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a  terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the  fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,  passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered  in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which  had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the  children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the  grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,  was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out  of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and  lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and  paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of  firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless  chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,  among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the  bakerâs shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of  bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that  was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting  chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every  farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant  drops of oil.",cloud settle saint antoine momentary gleam drive sacred countenance darkness heavy cold dirt sickness ignorance want lord wait saintly presence noble great power especially sample people undergo terrible grind regrinde mill certainly fabulous mill ground old people young shiver corner pass doorway look window flutter vestige garment wind shake mill work mill grind young people old child ancient face grave voice grow face plough furrow age come afresh sigh hunger prevalent hunger push tall house wretched clothing hang pole line hunger patch straw rag wood paper hunger repeat fragment small modicum firewood man saw hunger stare smokeless chimney start filthy street offal refuse eat hunger inscription shelf write small loaf scanty stock bad bread sausage shop dead dog preparation offer sale hunger rattle dry bone roasting chestnut turned cylinder hunger shre atomic farthing porringer husky chip potato fry reluctant drop oil
Dickens,Tale,"Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding  street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets  diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags  and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them  that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some  wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and  slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor  compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted  into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or  inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)  were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman  painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of  meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,  croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were  gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a  flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutlerâs knives  and axes were sharp and bright, the smithâs hammers were heavy, and the  gunmakerâs stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,  with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but  broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down  the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy  rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across  the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and  pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,  and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly  manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and  the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.",abide place thing fit narrow winding street offence stench narrow wind street diverging people rag nightcap smell rag nightcap visible thing brooding look look ill hunted air people wild beast thought possibility turn bay depressed slinking eye fire want compress lip white suppress forehead knit likeness gallow rope muse enduring inflict trade sign shop grim illustration want butcher porkman paint lean scrag meat baker coarse meagre loaf people rudely picture drink wine shop croak scanty measure thin wine beer gloweringly confidential represent flourish condition save tool weapon knife axis sharp bright hammer heavy stock murderous crippling stone pavement little reservoir mud water footway break abruptly door kennel amend run middle street run heavy rain run eccentric fit house street wide interval clumsy lamp sling rope pulley night lamplighter let light hoist feeble grove dim wick swing sickly manner overhead sea sea ship crew peril tempest
Dickens,Tale,"For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region  should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so  long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling  up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their  condition.

Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with  a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand  heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of  manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might  have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself  in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being  sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright  shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large  earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick  her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported  by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but  coughed just one grain of cough.

Dickens,Tale,"Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded  parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile  indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation  within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,  the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general  staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides  flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and  hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted  the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their  intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost  insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt  and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to  his young companionâs agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.  Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made  at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left  uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed  to crawl in.

To exclude the cold, one half of this  door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.  Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it  was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit  alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work  requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being  done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face  towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at  him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very  busy, making shoes.",garret build depository firewood like dim dark window dormer shape truth door roof little crane hoisting store street unglaze close middle piece like door french construction exclude cold half door fast closed open little way scanty portion light admit mean difficult come long habit slowly form ability work require nicety obscurity work kind garret door face window keeper wine shop stand look white haired man sit low bench stoop forward busy make shoe

Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was  the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo  of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and  resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once  beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and  suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground.

Dickens,Tale,"  Tellsonâs Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the  year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very  dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,  moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were  proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,  proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence  in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if  it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was  no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more  convenient places of business. Tellsonâs (they said) wanted  no elbow-room, Tellsonâs wanted no light, Tellsonâs wanted no  embellishment.

Dickens,Tale,"Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the  question of rebuilding Tellsonâs. In this respect the House was much  on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for  suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly  objectionable, but were only the more respectable.",partner disinherit son question rebuild respect house par country disinherit son suggest improvement law custom long highly objectionable respectable
Dickens,Tale,"Thus it had come to pass, that Tellsonâs was the triumphant perfection  of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with  a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellsonâs down two steps,  and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little  counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the  wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of  windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,  and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the  heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing  âthe House,â you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,  where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its  hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal  twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden  drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when  they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they  were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among  the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good  polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms  made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their  parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family  papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great  dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year  one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you  by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released  from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads  exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of  Abyssinia or Ashantee.",come pass triumphant perfection inconvenience burst open door idiotic obstinacy weak rattle throat fall step come sense miserable little shop little counter old man cheque shake wind rustle examine signature dingy window shower bath mud fleet street dingy iron bar proper heavy shadow temple bar business necessitate see house specie condemned hold meditate misspent life house come hand pocket hardly blink dismal twilight money come go wormy old wooden drawer particle fly nose throat open shut bank note musty odour fast decompose rag plate stow away neighbouring cesspool evil communication corrupt good polish day deed get extemporise strong room kitchen scullery fret fat parchment banking house air light box family paper go stair barmecide room great dining table dinner year thousand seven eighty letter write old love little child newly release horror ogle window head expose temple bar insensate brutality ferocity worthy abyssinia ashantee
Dickens,Tale,"But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue  with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellsonâs.  Death is Natureâs remedy for all things, and why not Legislationâs?  Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note  was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the  purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder  of a horse at Tellsonâs door, who made off with it, was put to  Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of  three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to  Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it  might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the  reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each  particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked  after. Thus, Tellsonâs, in its day, like greater places of business,  its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid  low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately  disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the  ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.",time put death recipe vogue trade profession death remedy thing accordingly forger death utterer bad note death unlawful opener letter death purloiner shilling sixpence death holder horse door death coiner bad shilling death sounder fourth note gamut crime death good way prevention worth remark fact exactly reverse clear world trouble particular case leave connect look day like great place business contemporary take life head lay low range temple bar instead privately disposed probably exclude little light ground floor significant manner
Dickens,Tale,"Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellsonâs, the  oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young  man into Tellsonâs London house, they hid him somewhere till he was  old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full  Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him.

He was never absent during business hours, unless  upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin  of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellsonâs,  in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always  tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted  this person to the post.

It  had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced  his own doom as certainly as the prisonerâs, and even died before him.  For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,  from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on  a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a  half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.  So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning.

Dickens,Tale,  CHAPTER III.  A Disappointment,chapter iii disappointment
Dickens,Tale,"  Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before  them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which  claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the  public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or  even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the  prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and  repassing between France and England, on secret business of which  he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of  traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real  wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.  That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who  was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the  prisonerâs schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his  Majestyâs Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.  That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and  attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisonerâs  friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his  infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish  in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues  were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public  benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as  they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,  as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well  knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;  whereat the juryâs countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that  they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more  especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.  That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness  for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had  communicated itself to the prisonerâs servant, and had engendered in him  a holy determination to examine his masterâs table-drawers and pockets,  and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to  hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,  in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-Generalâs)  brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.  Attorney-Generalâs) father and mother. That, he called with confidence  on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two  witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be  produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of  his Majestyâs forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by  sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed  such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be  proved to be in the prisonerâs handwriting; but that it was all the  same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as  showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof  would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged  in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the  very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.  That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they  were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must  positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether  they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their  pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying  their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion  of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that  there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon  pillows at all, unless the prisonerâs head was taken off. That head  Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of  everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith  of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as  good as dead and gone.",attorney general inform jury prisoner young year old treasonable practice claim forfeit life correspondence public enemy correspondence day yesterday year year certain prisoner long habit pass repasse france england secret business honest account nature traitorous way thrive happily real wickedness guilt business remain undiscovered providence heart person fear reproach ferret nature scheme strike horror disclose chief secretary state honourable privy council patriot produce position attitude sublime friend auspicious evil hour detect infamy resolve immolate traitor long cherish bosom sacred altar country statue decree britain ancient greece rome public benefactor shine citizen assuredly decreed probably virtue observe poet passage know jury word word tip tongue whereat countenance display guilty consciousness know passage manner contagious especially bright virtue know patriotism love country lofty example immaculate unimpeachable witness crown refer unworthily honour communicate servant engender holy determination examine table drawer pocket secrete paper attorney general prepare hear disparagement attempt admirable servant general way prefer attorney brother sister honour attorney father mother call confidence jury come likewise evidence witness couple document discovering produce prisoner furnish list force disposition preparation sea land leave doubt habitually convey information hostile power list prove handwriting well prosecution show prisoner artful precaution proof year prisoner engage pernicious mission week date action fight british troop americans reason jury loyal jury know responsible jury know positively find prisoner guilty end like lay head pillow tolerate idea wife lay head pillow endure notion child lay head pillow short theirs laying head pillow head take head attorney general conclude demand think round turn faith solemn asseveration consider prisoner good dead go

Dickens,Tale,"The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a  great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and  simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais  packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.  He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of  charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of  the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging  his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the  prisonerâs pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from  the drawer of the prisonerâs desk. He had not put them there first. He  had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen  at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and  Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldnât bear it, and had given  information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;  he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be  only a plated one.

Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him  a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he  undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,  when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the  lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would  hardly have thought the two were so alike.

Two or three times, the  matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on  him to get up, and steep his towels anew.

There were few buildings then,  north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers  grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields.

Occasionally, a stray  workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered  about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a  thump from the golden giant.

Dickens,Tale,"âIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which  had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of  its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by  prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone  in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to  execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with  some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.  At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully  examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or  legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses  were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested  that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The  floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the  earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found  the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case  or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he  had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.â",make alteration workman come old dungeon year build forget stone inner wall cover inscription carve prisoner date name complaint prayer corner stone angle wall prisoner go execution cut work letter poor instrument hurriedly unsteady hand read carefully examine letter find record legend prisoner initial fruitless guess length suggest letter initial complete word dig floor examine carefully inscription earth beneath stone tile fragment paving find ashe paper mingle ashe small leathern case bag unknown prisoner write read write hide away

Dickens,Tale,"  Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his  fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in  his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to  the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur  was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many  things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather  rapidly swallowing France; but, his morningâs chocolate could not so  much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four  strong men besides the Cook.",monseigneur great lord power court hold fortnightly reception grand hotel paris monseigneur inner room sanctuary sanctuary holiest holiests crowd worshipper suite room monseigneur chocolate monseigneur swallow great thing ease sullen mind suppose rapidly swallow france chocolate throat monseigneur aid strong man cook

It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the  Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his  pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to  conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneurâs lips. One lacquey carried  the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed  the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;  a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold  watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to  dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high  place under the admiring Heavens.

Dickens,Tale,"Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy  and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at  a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so  impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far  more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and  state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance  for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly  favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted  days of the merry Stuart who sold it.",monseigneur little supper night comedy grand opera charmingly represent monseigneur little supper night fascinating company polite impressible monseigneur comedy grand opera far influence tiresome article state affair state secret need france happy circumstance france like country similarly england way example regret day merry stuart sell
Dickens,Tale,"Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which  was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public  business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go  his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and  particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world  was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original  by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: âThe earth and the fulness  thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.â",monseigneur truly noble idea general public business let way particular public business monseigneur truly noble idea way tend power pocket pleasure general particular monseigneur truly noble idea world text order alter original pronoun run earth fulness thereof saith
Dickens,Tale,"Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into  his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of  affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances  public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and  must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances  private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after  generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence  Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet  time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could  wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,  poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with  a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer  rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior  mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked  down upon him with the loftiest contempt.",monseigneur slowly find vulgar embarrassment creep affair private public class affair ally perforce farmer general finance public monseigneur consequently let somebody finance private farmer generals rich monseigneur generation great luxury expense grow poor monseigneur take sister convent time ward impending veil cheap garment wear bestow prize rich farmer general poor family farmer general carry appropriate cane golden apple company outer room prostrate mankind except superior mankind blood monseigneur wife include look lofty contempt
Dickens,Tale,"A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his  stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women  waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and  forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial  relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality  among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.",sumptuous man farmer general thirty horse stand stable male domestic sit hall body woman wait wife pretend plund forage farmer general howsoever matrimonial relation conduce social morality great reality personage attend hotel monseigneur day
Dickens,Tale,"For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with  every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could  achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any  reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not  so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost  equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would  have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have  been anybodyâs business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers  destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;  civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the  worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;  all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in  pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of  Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which  anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the  score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,  yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives  passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were  no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies  for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly  patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had  discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the  State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to  root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears  they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving  Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making  card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving  Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this  wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of  the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been  since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural  subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of  exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various  notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies  among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half  of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among  the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and  appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of  bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far  towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing  known to the fashion.

Dickens,Tale,"The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance  upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional  people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that  things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting  them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic  sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves  whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the  spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the  Future, for Monseigneurâs guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other  three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a  jargon about âthe Centre of Truth:â holding that Man had got out of the  Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got  out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of  the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,  by fasting and seeing of spirits.

The exquisite gentlemen  of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they  languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;  and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and  fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and  his devouring hunger far away.",comfort company grand hotel monseigneur perfectly dressed day judgment ascertain dress day everybody eternally correct frizzling powdering stick hair delicate complexion artificially preserve mend gallant sword look delicate honour sense smell surely go exquisite gentleman fine breeding wear little pendent trinket chink languidly move golden fetter ring like precious little bell ringing rustle silk brocade fine linen flutter air fan saint antoine devouring hunger far away

In those two compressions, or dints, the only little  change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing  colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted  by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of  treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with  attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the  line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much  too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a  handsome face, and a remarkable one.",man handsomely dress haughty manner face like fine mask face transparent paleness feature clearly define set expression nose beautifully form slightly pinch nostril compression dint little change face show reside persist change colour occasionally dilate contract like faint pulsation give look treachery cruelty countenance examine attention capacity help look find line mouth line orbit eye horizontal thin effect face handsome face remarkable

Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had  stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer  in his manner.

Dickens,Tale,"  More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles  Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French  language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he  would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with  young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a  living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for  its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in  sound English, and render them into sound English.

Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with  solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one  oâclock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,  took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought  forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other  fishing tackle of that nature.

Dickens,Tale,"The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped  under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low  brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and  wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which  the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.  Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that  Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well  defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.  He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the  third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay  there a little--listening perhaps.

They  were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for  the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a  screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were  strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the  earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what  it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to  wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he  made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.",long cherish desire know matter stop run away lure fish perseveringly peep gate second time get bite screwing complain sound bent figure strain weight slow degree weight break away earth come surface young jerry know see see honoured parent wrench open frightened new sight stop run mile

He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen  was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt  upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him  and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to  shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it  was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the  roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them  like a dropsical boyâs kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways  too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up  to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,  and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was  incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy  got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then  it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every  stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on  his breast when he fell asleep.",stop necessary breath spectral sort race run highly desirable end strong idea coffin see run picture hop bolt upright narrow end point overtake hop take arm pursuer shun inconsistent ubiquitous fiend make night dreadful dart roadway avoid dark alley fearful come hopping like dropsical kite tail wing hide doorway rub horrible shoulder door draw ear laugh get shadow road lie cunningly trip time incessantly hop gain boy get door reason half dead leave follow upstairs bump stair scramble bed bump dead heavy breast fall asleep

Dickens,Tale,"  There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where  the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the  highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his  poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the  crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,  but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of  them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not  be what he was ordered.",change village fountain fall mender road go forth daily hammer stone highway morsel bread serve patch hold poor ignorant soul poor reduce body prison crag dominant yore soldier guard officer guard soldier know man probably order

Dickens,Tale,"Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national  blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of  luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;  nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought  things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for  Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must  be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it  was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the  flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that  its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing  to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and  unaccountable.",monseigneur worthy individual gentleman national blessing give chivalrous tone thing polite example luxurious shine life great deal equal purpose monseigneur class bring thing strange creation design expressly monseigneur soon wring dry squeeze short sighted eternal arrangement surely drop blood have extract flint screw rack have turn purchase crumble turn turn bite monseigneur begin run away phenomenon low unaccountable
Dickens,Tale,"But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like  it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung  it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures  of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting  the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces  of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in  the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the  disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and  beautifying features of Monseigneur.",change village village like score year go monseigneur squeeze wring seldom grace presence pleasure chase find hunt people find hunt beast preservation monseigneur edify space barbarous barren wilderness change consist appearance strange face low caste disappearance high caste chisel beautify beautify feature monseigneur
Dickens,Tale,"For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the  dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and  to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in  thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if  he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,  and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on  foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now  a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern  without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian  aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a  mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many  highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled  with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.",time mender road work solitary dust trouble reflect dust dust return occupy think little supper eat time raise eye lonely labour view prospect rough figure approach foot like rarity part frequent presence advance mender road discern surprise shaggy haired man barbarian aspect tall wooden shoe clumsy eye mender road grim rough swart steep mud dust highway dank marshy moisture low ground sprinkle thorn leave moss byway wood

Dickens,Tale,"As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling  away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to  by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap  now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the  heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used  his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.  The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen  red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of  beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen  and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender  of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were  footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed  with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long  leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into  sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at  secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept  with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.  Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and  drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against  this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and  looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no  obstacle, tending to centres all over France.",road mender ply dusty labour hail cloud roll away reveal bright bar streak sky respond silver gleam landscape little man wear red cap place blue fascinated figure heap stone eye turn tool mechanically say poor account bronze face shaggy black hair beard coarse woollen red cap rough medley dress home spin stuff hairy skin beast powerful frame attenuate spare living sullen desperate compression lip sleep inspire mender road awe traveller travel far foot footsore ankle chafe bleed great shoe stuff leave grass heavy drag long league clothe chafe hole sore stoop road mender try peep secret weapon breast vain sleep arm cross set resolutely lip fortified town stockade guard house gate trench drawbridge mender road air figure lift eye horizon look see small fancy similar figure stop obstacle tend centre france

When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,  as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A  curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered  together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of  looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,  chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top  alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his  chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to  the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need  to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.",mender road go home dust go accord set wind soon fountain squeeze lean kine bring drink appear whisper whispering village village take poor supper creep bed usually come door remain curious contagion whispering gather fountain dark curious contagion look expectantly sky direction monsieur gabelle chief functionary place uneasy go house look direction glance chimney darkening face fountain send word sacristan keep key church nee ring tocsin bye
Dickens,Tale,"The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its  solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened  the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace  flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a  swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through  the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the  stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis  had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four  heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the  branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard.

Dickens,Tale,"But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely  visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.  Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,  picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,  and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.  Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the  stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.",long presently chateau begin strangely visible light grow luminous flickering streak play architecture pick transparent place show balustrade arch window soar higher grow broad bright soon score great window flame burst forth stone face awaken stare fire
Dickens,Tale,"A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left  there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was  spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the  space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur  Gabelleâs door. âHelp, Gabelle! Help, every one!â The tocsin rang  impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none.

Dickens,Tale,"The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away  through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on  the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;  removed from them, a group of soldiers. âHelp, gentlemen--officers! The  chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by  timely aid!

The mender of roads, and the two hundred and  fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of  lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in  every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,  occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of  Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on  that functionaryâs part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to  authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,  and that post-horses would roast.",rider rattle hill street village illuminate mender road particular friend inspire man woman idea light dart house put candle dull little pane glass general scarcity occasion candle borrow peremptory manner monsieur gabelle moment reluctance hesitation mender road submissive authority remark carriage good bonfire post horse roast
Dickens,Tale,"The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and  raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the  infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising  and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in  torment.

Great rents and  splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied  birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures  trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded  roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next  destination.

Whereupon,  Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel  with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again  withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time  resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man  of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the  parapet, and crush a man or two below.",village light head famine fire bell ringing bethink monsieur gabelle collection rent taxis small instalment taxis rent gabelle get day impatient interview surround house summon come forth personal conference monsieur gabelle heavily bar door retire hold counsel result conference gabelle withdraw housetop stack chimney time resolve door break small southern man retaliative temperament pitch head foremost parapet crush man

A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of  the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur  Gabelle had resolved!

It was too  much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it  was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this  terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under  the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or  omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched  millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that  should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,  years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such  vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the  restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,  and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured  without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was  such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood  in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had  already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.",dialogue take place usual desk monseigneur swarm yard boastful avenge rascal people long way monseigneur reverse refugee way native british orthodoxy talk terrible revolution harvest know sky sow omit lead observer wretched million france misused pervert resource prosperous see inevitably come year plain word record see vapouring combine extravagant plot monseigneur restoration state thing utterly exhaust wear heaven earth hard endure remonstrance sane man know truth vapouring ear like troublesome confusion blood head add latent uneasiness mind charles darnay restless keep

Dickens,Tale,"The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two  men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of  the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than  the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.  False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their  hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with  howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of  sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung  forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women  held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping  blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks  struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and  fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from  the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the  sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all  over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain  upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of womenâs lace  and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through  and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be  sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to  the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments  of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And  as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream  of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in  their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have  given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.",grindstone double handle turn madly man face long hair flap whirling grindstone bring face horrible cruel visage wildest savage barbarous disguise false eyebrow false moustache stick hideous countenance bloody sweaty awry howling stare glare beastly excitement want sleep ruffian turn turn matted lock fling forward eye fling backward neck woman hold wine mouth drink dropping blood drop wine stream spark strike stone wicked atmosphere gore fire eye detect creature group free smear blood shoulder sharpening stone man strip waist stain limb body man sort rag stain rag man devilishly set spoil lace silk ribbon stain dye trifle hatchet knife bayonet sword bring sharpen red hacked sword tie wrist carry strip linen fragment dress ligature kind deep colour frantic wielder weapon snatch stream spark tear away street red hue red frenzied unbrutalised beholder give year life petrify direct gun

As there was no business objection to  this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and  he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry  went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up  in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows  of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.",noon come doctor return delay tend compromise lorry advise lucie say father speak hire lodging short term quarter near banking house business objection foresaw charles release hope leave city lorry go quest lodging find suitable high remove street close blind window high melancholy square building mark deserted home

That, in the prison he had  found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were  brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth  to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back  to their cells.

That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as  a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded  to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and  examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when  the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible  to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,  the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that  the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held  inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner  was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the  Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and  assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,  delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had  often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and  had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.",ascertain register table son law live prisoner plead hard tribunal member asleep awake dirty murder clean sober life liberty frantic greeting lavish notable sufferer overthrown system accord charles darnay bring lawless court examine point release tide favour meet unexplained check intelligible doctor lead word secret conference man sit president inform doctor manette prisoner remain custody sake hold inviolate safe custody immediately signal prisoner remove interior prison doctor strongly plead permission remain assure son law malice mischance deliver concourse murderous yell outside gate drown proceeding obtain permission remain hall blood danger
Dickens,Tale,"The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by  intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were  saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against  those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had  been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had  thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress  the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him  in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies  of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this  awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man  with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him  carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged  anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes  with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.",sight see brief snatch food sleep interval shall remain untold mad joy prisoner save astound scarcely mad ferocity cut piece prisoner say discharge street free mistaken savage thrust pike pass besought dress wound doctor pass gate find arm company samaritans seat body victim inconsistency monstrous awful nightmare help healer tend wounded man gentle solicitude litter escort carefully spot catch weapon plunge anew butchery dreadful doctor cover eye hand swoon away midst

Dickens,Tale,"But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never  at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor  felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time  he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which  could break the prison door of his daughterâs husband, and deliver him.  âIt all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.  As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be  helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid  of Heaven I will do it!â Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw  the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing  of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a  clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which  had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.",see friend present aspect know present character time doctor feel suffering strength power time feel sharp fire slowly forge iron break prison door husband deliver tend good end friend mere waste ruin beloved child helpful restore helpful restore dear aid heaven doctor manette jarvis lorry see kindled eye resolute face calm strong look bear man life stop like clock year set go energy lie dormant cessation usefulness believe
Dickens,Tale,"Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would  have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself  in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees  of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his  personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician  of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie  that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the  general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet  messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself  sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctorâs hand), but she was  not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of  plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were  known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.",great thing doctor time contend yield persevere purpose keep place physician business degree mankind bond free rich poor bad good personal influence wisely soon inspect physician prison la force assure lucie husband long confine mixed general body prisoner see husband weekly bring sweet message straight lip husband send letter hand permit write wild suspicion plot prison wildest point emigrant know friend permanent connection abroad
Dickens,Tale,"This new life of the Doctorâs was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the  sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.  Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;  but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that  time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter  and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.  Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through  that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charlesâs  ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,  that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to  trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself  and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and  affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in  rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. âAll  curious to see,â thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, âbut all  natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it  couldnât be in better hands.â",new life anxious life doubt sagacious lorry see new sustain pride unbecoming tinge pride natural worthy observe curiosity doctor know time imprisonment associate mind daughter friend personal affliction deprivation weakness change know invest old trial force look ultimate safety deliverance far exalt change take lead direction require weak trust strong precede relative position lucie reverse lively gratitude affection reverse pride render service render curious think lorry amiably shrewd way natural right lead dear friend well
Dickens,Tale,"But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get  Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,  the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new  era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of  Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death  against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the  great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise  against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils  of France, as if the dragonâs teeth had been sown broadcast, and  had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and  alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of  the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds  and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the  fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.

Dickens,Tale,"There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no  measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when  time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other  count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever  of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the  unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the  head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the  head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned  widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.",pause pity peace interval relent rest measurement time day night circle regularly time young evening morning day count time hold lose rage fever nation fever patient break unnatural silence city executioner show people head king breath head fair wife weary month imprisoned widowhood misery turn grey
Dickens,Tale,"And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in  all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A  revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand  revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,  which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over  any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged  with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;  these things became the established order and nature of appointed  things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.  Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before  the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the  sharp female called La Guillotine.",observe strange law contradiction obtain case time long flame fast revolutionary tribunal capital thousand revolutionary committee land law suspected strike away security liberty life deliver good innocent person bad guilty prison gorge people commit offence obtain hearing thing establish order nature appoint thing ancient usage week old hideous figure grow familiar general gaze foundation world figure sharp female call la guillotine

Dickens,Tale,"It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,  were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young  Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed  the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and  good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one  dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.  The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief  functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his  namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of Godâs own Temple every  day.",shear head ground polluted rotten red take piece like toy puzzle young devil occasion want hush eloquent strike powerful abolish beautiful good friend high public mark living dead lop head morning minute strong man old scripture descend chief functionary work armed strong namesake blinder tear away gate temple day
Dickens,Tale,"Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked  with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his  end, never doubting that he would save Lucieâs husband at last. Yet the  current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time  away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three  months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more  wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,  that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the  violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares  under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the  terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at  that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable  in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and  victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the  appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all  other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if  he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were  a Spirit moving among mortals.",terror brood belong doctor walk steady head confident power cautiously persistent end doubt save husband current time sweep strong deep carry time away fiercely charles lain prison year month doctor steady confident wicked distracted revolution grow december month river south encumber body violently drown night prisoner shoot line square southern wintry sun doctor walk terror steady head man well know paris day man strange situation silent humane indispensable hospital prison art equally assassin victim man apart exercise skill appearance story bastille captive remove man suspect bring question recall life eighteen year spirit move mortal

The  slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief  that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy  return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the  solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many  unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only  outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.",soon establish new residence father enter routine avocation arrange little household exactly husband appoint place appoint time little lucie teach regularly unite english home slight device cheat belief soon reunite little preparation speedy return setting aside chair book solemn prayer night dear prisoner especially unhappy soul prison shadow death outspoken relief heavy mind

She lost her colour,  and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,  thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at  night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had  repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,  was on him.

Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in  five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not  for a week or a fortnight together.

Dickens,Tale,"The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole  surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got  somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in  with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike  and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his  saw inscribed as his âLittle Sainte Guillotineâ--for the great sharp  female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he  was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.",miserable shop wood sawyer small surface furnish indifferent space legend get somebody scrawl squeeze death inappropriate difficulty house display pike cap good citizen window station saw inscribe sainte great sharp female time popularly canonise shop shut relief lucie leave
Dickens,Tale,"But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement  and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment  afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the  prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with  The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and  they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music  than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,  keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.  Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced  together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a  mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they  filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly  apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They  advanced, retreated, struck at one anotherâs hands, clutched at one  anotherâs heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round  in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest  linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,  and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they  all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then  reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped  again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width  of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high  up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible  as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once  innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into  a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the  heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how  warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly  bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-childâs head thus distracted, the  delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of  the disjointed time.",far presently hear troubled movement shouting come fill fear moment throng people come pour round corner prison wall midst wood sawyer hand hand vengeance few people dance like thousand demon music singing dance popular revolution song keep ferocious time like gnashing tooth unison man woman dance woman dance man dance hazard bring mere storm coarse red cap coarse woollen rag fill place stop dance lucie ghastly apparition dance figure go rave mad arise advance retreat strike hand clutch head spin round catch spin round pair drop rest link hand hand spin round ring break separate ring turn turn stop begin strike clutched tear reverse spin spin round way suddenly stop paused strike time afresh form line width public way head low hand high swoop scream fight half terrible dance emphatically fall sport innocent deliver devilry healthy pastime change means anger blood bewilder sense steel heart grace visible uglier show warp pervert thing good nature maidenly bosom bare pretty head distract delicate foot mince slough blood dirt type disjointed time

The prisoners were far from  insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the  time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour  or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to  brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere  boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind.

The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never  without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing  spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,  anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check.

Citizen  Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the  pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of  enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly  overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out  of the Tribunalâs patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he  had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Juryâs  declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was  answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen EvrÃ©monde,  called Darnay.",doctor take care assure stage proceeding produce read citizen gabelle call confirm citizen gabelle hint infinite delicacy politeness pressure business impose tribunal multitude enemy republic deal slightly overlook prison abbaye fact pass patriotic remembrance day ago summon set liberty declare satisfied accusation answer surrender citizen evrã monde call darnay

His high personal popularity,  and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he  proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his  release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in  England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in  their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat  government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as  the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these  circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the  straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the  populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur  Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,  had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his  account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that  they were ready with their votes if the President were content to  receive them.",doctor manette question high personal popularity clearness answer great impression proceed show accused friend release long imprisonment accuse remain england faithful devoted daughter exile far favour aristocrat government actually try life foe england friend united states bring circumstance view great discretion straightforward force truth earnestness jury populace appeal monsieur lorry english gentleman present like witness english trial corroborate account jury declare hear ready vote president content receive

Dickens,Tale,"Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace  sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards  generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against  their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of  these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,  to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner  was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood  at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the  prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after  his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from  exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same  people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with  the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the  streets.",begin extraordinary scene populace gratify fickleness well impulse generosity mercy regard set swollen account cruel rage man decide motive extraordinary scene referable probable blending second predominating soon acquittal pronounce tear shed freely blood time fraternal embrace bestow prisoner sex rush long unwholesome confinement danger faint exhaustion know people carry current rush intensity rend piece strew street

In this car of triumph, not  even the Doctorâs entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home  on menâs shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,  and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that  he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he  was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.",great chair take court room passage chair throw red flag bind pike red cap car triumph entreaty prevent carry home shoulder confused sea red cap heave cast sight stormy deep wreck face misdoubte mind confusion tumbril way guillotine

Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the  crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and  overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the riverâs bank,  and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled  them away.",hold heart turn beautiful head face brawling crowd tear lip come unseen people fall dancing instantly rest fall dancing courtyard overflow carmagnole elevate vacant chair young woman crowd carry goddess liberty swell overflow adjacent street bank bridge carmagnole absorb whirl away

Partly on this account, and  partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and  citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them  occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by  Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every  night.",housekeeping frugal kind safe way life involve offence people rich charles imprisonment pay heavily bad food guard living poor prisoner partly account partly avoid domestic spy keep servant citizen citizeness act porter courtyard gate render occasional service jerry wholly transfer lorry daily retainer bed night

He  knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint  Antoine and Defargeâs wine-shop; had received from the watchful police  such heads of information concerning Doctor Manetteâs imprisonment,  release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to  familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame  Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered  with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he  talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.  He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over  again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the  guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as  he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that  he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of  his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning  terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such  grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw  that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many  proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash  his last chance of life.

The  horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with  their swords.

He has  no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the  girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised  against him.

Dickens,Expectations,"Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine  medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;  having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the  best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a  choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like  a new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded  a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater  comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be  held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to  swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and  meditating before the fire), âbecause he had had a turn.â Judging from  myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had  none before.",medical beast revive tar water day fine medicine joe keep supply cupboard have belief virtue correspondent nastiness good time elixir administer choice restorative conscious go smell like new fence particular evening urgency case demand pint mixture pour throat great comfort joe hold head arm boot hold bootjack joe get half pint swallow disturbance sit slowly munch meditate fire judging certainly turn
Dickens,Expectations,"Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in  the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret  burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great  punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. JoeâI  never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the  housekeeping property as hisâunited to the necessity of always keeping  one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about  the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,  as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the  voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to  secrecy, declaring that he couldnât and wouldnât starve until  to-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the  young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his  hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should  mistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and  liver to-night, instead of to-morrow!

I stole  some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I  tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last nightâs slice), some  brandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had  secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,  Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from  a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and  a beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without the  pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that  was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,  and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not  intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.",soon great black velvet pall outside little window shoot grey get go downstairs board way crack board call pantry far abundantly supply usual owe season alarm hare hang heel think catch half turn winking time verification time selection time time spare steal bread rind cheese half jar mincemeat tie pocket handkerchief slice brandy stone bottle decant glass bottle secretly make intoxicate fluid spanish liquorice water room dilute stone bottle jug kitchen cupboard meat bone little beautiful round compact pork pie nearly go away pie tempt mount shelf look away carefully cover earthenware dish corner find pie take hope intend early use miss time

Now, I saw  the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort  of spidersâ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.  On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so  thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our  villageâa direction which they never accepted, for they never came  thereâwas invisible to me until I was quite close under it.

However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last  too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the  river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes  that staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I  had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and  had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man  sitting before me.

Dickens,Expectations,"My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that  is to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a  well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he  was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.  Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and  everything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive  occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,  the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,  I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young  offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and  delivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged  majesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being  born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,  and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I  was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make  them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the  free use of my limbs.",sister have go church vicariously joe go working clothe joe knit characteristic look blacksmith holiday clothe like scarecrow good circumstance wear fit belong wear graze present festive occasion emerge room blithe bell go picture misery suit sunday penitential think sister general idea young offender accoucheur policeman take birthday deliver deal accord outraged majesty law treat insist bear opposition dictate reason religion morality dissuade argument good friend take new suit clothe tailor order like kind reformatory account let free use limb
Dickens,Expectations,"Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle  for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to  what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.  Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be  equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had  done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the  Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the  terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived  the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman  said, âYe are now to declare it!â would be the time for me to rise and  propose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure  that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to  this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.",joe go church move spectacle compassionate mind suffer outside undergo terror assail joe go near pantry room equal remorse mind dwelt hand weight wicked secret ponder church powerful shield vengeance terrible young man divulge establishment conceive idea time bann read clergyman say declare time rise propose private conference vestry far sure astonish small congregation resort extreme measure christmas day sunday

The dinner hour was  half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and  Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked  (it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and  everything most splendid.

Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large  shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud  of; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could  only give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he  himself confessed that if the Church was âthrown open,â meaning to  competition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Church  not being âthrown open,â he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he  punished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,âalways  giving the whole verse,âhe looked all round the congregation first, as  much as to say, âYou have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your  opinion of this style!â",time come bring relief feeling company come wopsle unite roman nose large shine bald forehead deep voice uncommonly proud understand acquaintance head read clergyman fit confess church open mean competition despair make mark church open say clerk punish amens tremendously give psalm give verse look round congregation hear friend overhead oblige opinion

No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have  left me alone. But they wouldnât leave me alone.

They had not enjoyed  themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened  with the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively  anticipation of âthe two villainsâ being taken, and when the bellows  seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke  to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and  all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the  blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale  afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have  turned pale on their account, poor wretches.",watch stand cluster forge enjoy think terrible good sauce dinner fugitive friend marsh enjoy quarter entertainment brighten excitement furnish lively anticipation take bellow roar fugitive fire flare smoke hurry away pursuit joe hammer clink murky shadow wall shake menace blaze rise sink red hot spark drop die pale afternoon outside pity young fancy turn pale account poor wretch
Dickens,Expectations,"At last, Joeâs job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As  Joe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us  should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.  Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladiesâ  society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was  agreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should  have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joeâs curiosity to know  all about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, âIf  you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, donât  look to me to put it together again.â",job ringing roaring stop joe get coat muster courage propose soldier come hunt pumblechook hubble decline plea pipe society wopsle say joe joe say agreeable joe approve get leave sure curiosity know end merely stipulate bring boy head blow bit musket look

His men resumed their muskets and fell in.  Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and  to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in  the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I  treasonably whispered to Joe, âI hope, Joe, we shanât find them.â and  Joe whispered to me, âIâd give a shilling if they had cut and run,  Pip.â",sergeant take polite leave lady part pumblechook comrade doubt fully sensible merit arid condition moist go man resume musket fall wopsle joe receive strict charge rear speak word reach marsh raw air steadily move business treasonably whisper joe hope joe find joe whisper shilling cut run
Dickens,Expectations,"We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was  cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming  on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A  few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came  out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.  There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeantâs  hand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the  graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding  anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate  at the side of the churchyard.

There I was, on Joeâs  back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a  hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and  to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a  pretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking  the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.  Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.

Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by  his blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and  could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful  start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a  sheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;  and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared  angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except  these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,  there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.",heart thump like blacksmith broad shoulder look sign convict hear wopsle greatly alarm blowing hard breathing know sound time dissociate object pursuit get dreadful start think hear file go sheep bell sheep stop eating look timidly cattle head turn wind sleet stare angrily hold responsible annoyance thing shudder die day blade grass break bleak stillness marsh

For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a  long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but  it was long and loud.

After another momentâs listening,  Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)  agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not  be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men  should make towards it âat the double.â So we slanted to the right  (where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had  to hold on tight to keep my seat.",effect sergeant near man speak breath joe come listening joe good judge agree wopsle bad judge agree sergeant decisive man order sound answer course change man slant right east joe pound away wonderfully hold tight seat

As we came nearer to the shouting, it became  more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.  Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.  When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate  than ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,  that we could hear one voice calling âMurder!â and another voice,  âConvicts! Runaways! Guard!

There was a reasonably good  path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and  there where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy  sluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming  in after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon  the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I  could see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air  about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather  to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets.

Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in  their great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their  heads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again.

Dickens,Expectations,"I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference  to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I  loved Joe,âperhaps for no better reason in those early days than  because the dear fellow let me love him,âand, as to him, my inner self  was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when  I first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe  the whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted  that if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing  Joeâs confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at  night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up  my tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I  never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair  whisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe  knew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at  yesterdayâs meat or pudding when it came on to-dayâs table, without  thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That,  if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life  remarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he  suspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word,  I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too  cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.

Mr. Pumblechook  made out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he had first got  upon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the  house, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made  of his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very  positive and drove his own chaise-cartâover everybodyâit was agreed  that it must be so. Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, âNo!â with  the feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat  on, he was unanimously set at naught,ânot to mention his smoking hard  behind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp  out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.",time staggering kitchen floor like little drunkard have newly set foot have fast asleep wake heat light noise tongue come aid heavy thump shoulder restorative exclamation boy sister find joe tell confession visitor suggest different way get pantry pumblechook carefully survey premise get roof forge get roof house let kitchen chimney rope bedding cut strip pumblechook positive drive chaise agree wopsle wildly cry feeble malice tired man theory coat unanimously set naught mention smoking hard stand kitchen fire draw damp calculate inspire confidence

Neither were my  notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at  all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my  declaration that I was to âwalk in the same all the days of my life,â  laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our  house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down  by the wheelwrightâs or up by the mill.",time stand churchyard read family tombstone learning able spell construction simple meaning correct read complimentary reference exaltation well world deceased relation refer doubt form bad opinion member family notion theological position catechism bind accurate lively remembrance suppose declaration day life lay obligation village house particular direction vary turn mill

Dickens,Expectations,"Mr. Wopsleâs great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is  to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited  infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in  the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the  improving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage,  and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to  overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and  occasionally bumping on the ceiling.

Dickens,Expectations,"Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight oâclock in the parlour  behind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of  bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered  Mr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my  sisterâs idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be  imparted to my diet,âbesides giving me as much crumb as possible in  combination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm  water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the  milk out altogether,âhis conversation consisted of nothing but  arithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,  pompously, âSeven times nine, boy?â And how should _I_ be able to  answer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I  was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum  that lasted all through the breakfast. âSeven?â âAnd four?â âAnd  eight?â âAnd six?â âAnd two?â âAnd ten?â And so on. And after each  figure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a  sup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,  and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)  a gorging and gormandizing manner.",pumblechook breakfast parlour shop shopman take mug tea hunch bread butter sack pea premise consider pumblechook wretche company possess idea mortifying penitential character ought imparted diet give crumb possible combination little butter put quantity warm water milk candid leave milk altogether conversation consist arithmetic politely bid good morning say pompously time able answer dodge way strange place stomach hungry swallow morsel begin running sum last breakfast figure dispose bite sup come sit ease guess eat bacon hot roll allow expression gorging gormandizing manner
Dickens,Expectations,"For such reasons, I was very glad when ten oâclock came and we started  for Miss Havishamâs; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the  manner in which I should acquit myself under that ladyâs roof. Within a  quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havishamâs house, which was of old  brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the  windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were  rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so  we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to  open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.  Pumblechook said, âAnd fourteen?â but I pretended not to hear him), and  saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing  was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long  time.",reason glad come start miss ease manner acquit roof quarter hour come miss house old brick dismal great iron bar window wall remain low rustily bar courtyard bar wait ring bell come open wait gate peep pumblechook say pretend hear see house large brewery brewing go go long long time

The  brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the  wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood  open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.

I saw  that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and  like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her  sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure  of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had  shrunk to skin and bone.

All the uses and scents of the brewery might have  evaporated with its last reek of smoke.

But  she seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation  presented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking  on them at the end of the yard of casks.

I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havishamâs as  my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I  felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and  although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an  impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my  dragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before  the contemplation of Mrs. Joe.

Dickens,Expectations,"The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsleâs great-aunt  may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and  put straws down one anotherâs backs, until Mr. Wopsleâs great-aunt  collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with  a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,  the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand  to hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a  little spelling,âthat is to say, it had had once. As soon as this  volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsleâs great-aunt fell into a state of  coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils  then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the  subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the  hardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a  rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they  had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more  illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have  since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various  specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part  of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between  Biddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave  out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,âor  what we couldnâtâin a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,  shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or  reverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had  lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsleâs great-aunt,  who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was  understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into  the air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that  there was no prohibition against any pupilâs entertaining himself with  a slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not  easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of  the little general shop in which the classes were holdenâand which was  also Mr. Wopsleâs great-auntâs sitting-room and bedchamberâbeing but  faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle  and no snuffers.",educational scheme course establish great aunt resolve follow synopsis pupil eat apple straw back great aunt collect energy indiscriminate totter birch rod receive charge mark derision pupil form line buzzingly pass ragged book hand hand book alphabet figure table little spelling soon volume begin circulate great aunt fall state coma arise sleep rheumatic paroxysm pupil enter competitive examination subject boots view ascertain tread hard toe mental exercise last biddy rush distribute defaced bible shape unskilfully cut chump end illegibly print good curiosity literature meet speckle ironmould have specimen insect world smash leave course usually lighten single combat biddy refractory student fight biddy give number page read aloud frightful chorus biddy lead high shrill monotonous voice have notion reverence read horrible din last certain time mechanically awake great aunt stagger boy fortuitously pull ear understand terminate course evening emerge air shriek intellectual victory fair remark prohibition entertain slate ink easy pursue branch study winter season account little general shop class great sitting room faintly illuminated agency low spirited dip candle snuffer

This  was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been  some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;  but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of  garden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the  window, as if it pelted me for coming there.",open ground look miserable corner neglect garden rank ruin cabbage stalk box tree clip round long ago like pudding new growth shape different colour pudding stick saucepan get burn homely think contemplate box tree light snow overnight lie knowledge melt cold shadow bit garden wind catch little eddy throw window pelt come

It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but  every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and  dropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a  tablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the  house and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece  of some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily  overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,  as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its  seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with  blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some  circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in  the spider community.",cross staircase landing enter room indicate room daylight completely exclude airless smell oppressive fire lately kindle damp old fashioned grate disposed burn reluctant smoke hang room cold clear air marsh mist certain wintry branch candle high chimney piece faintly light chamber expressive faintly trouble darkness spacious dare handsome discernible thing cover dust mould drop piece prominent object long table tablecloth spread feast preparation house clock stop epergne centre piece kind middle cloth heavily overhung cobwebs form undistinguishable look yellow expanse remember grow like black fungus see speckle legged spider blotchy body run home run circumstance great public importance transpire spider community

Without having any definite idea of the penalties I  had incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go  stalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and  pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves  open to severe punishment.

Over and over and over  again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as  long as three hours at a stretch.

Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we  were alone, âDoes she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?â And when I said  yes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when  we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish  of Estellaâs moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods  were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled  what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish  fondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like âBreak their  hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!â",estella let tell kiss coldly tolerate condescend familiar tell energetically hate miss havisham ask whisper grow pretty pretty say yes enjoy greedily play card miss havisham look miserly relish mood mood contradictory puzzle miss havisham embrace lavish fondness murmur ear sound like heart pride hope break heart
Dickens,Expectations,"There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which  the burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of  rendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in  that relation towards smiths.

After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,  and Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so  subdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in  the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.",song joe hum fragment forge burden old clem ceremonious way render homage patron saint believe old clem stand relation smith song imitate measure beat iron mere lyrical excuse introduction old respect hammer boy clem thump clem beat beat clem clink clem blow fire blow clem roaring dryer soar clem day soon appearance chair miss havisham suddenly say impatient movement finger surprised croon ditty push floor happen catch fancy take low brooding voice singe sleep customary move estella join strain subdue noise grim old house light breath wind

The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of  mind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before  him,âas it were, to operate upon,âand he would drag me up from my stool  (usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me  before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,  âNow, Mum, here is this boy!

In these dialogues, my sister  spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at  every reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,  would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of  my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.",sister pair nonsensical speculation miss havisham burst spiteful tear fly pumblechook pummel dialogue sister speak morally wrench tooth reference pumblechook self constitute patron sit supervise depreciatory eye like architect fortune think engage unremunerative job

There was a most irritating  end to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to  lead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching  sight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, âCome!  thereâs enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_âve given trouble  enough for one night, I hope!â As if I had besought them as a favour to  bother my life out.",discussion joe bear talk progress reason perceive favourable take forge fully old apprentice joe joe sit poker knee thoughtfully rake ashe low bar sister distinctly construe innocent action opposition dive poker hand shake away irritating end debate moment lead sister stop yawn catch sight incidentally swoop bed give trouble night beseech favour bother life

He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of  great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even  seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by  mere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his  dinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the  Wandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention  of ever coming back.

I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being  cut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to  seed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was  a mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the  identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When  Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively  apologetic, Pumblechookâs indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,  too, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and  maudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating  circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every  occasion; it became sheer monomania in my masterâs daughter to care a  button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating  conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general  feebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle  had closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his  head, and saying, âTake warning, boy, take warning!â as if it were a  well-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided  I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.",assist representation george barnwell know long usually know take half past clock night wopsle get newgate think scaffold slow period disgraceful career think little complain cut short flower run seed leaf leaf course begin mere question length wearisomeness sting identification affair unoffending self barnwell begin wrong declare feel positively apologetic indignant stare tax wopsle take pain present bad light ferocious maudlin murder uncle extenuating circumstance millwood argument occasion sheer monomania daughter care button gasping procrastinating conduct fatal morning worthy general feebleness character happily hang wopsle close book pumblechook sit stare shake head say warning boy know fact contemplate murder near relation provide induce weakness benefactor

Dickens,Expectations,"  With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to  believe that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,  or at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under  obligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than  any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began  to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all  sides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.",head george barnwell dispose believe hand attack sister event near relation popularly know obligation legitimate object suspicion clear light morning begin reconsider matter hear discuss side take view case reasonable
Dickens,Expectations,"Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a  quarter after eight oâclock to a quarter before ten. While he was  there, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had  exchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not  be more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into  dense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been  before nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found  her struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance.

Dickens,Expectations,"Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond  the blowing out of the candle,âwhich stood on a table between the door  and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and  was struck,âwas there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such  as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one  remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with  something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were  dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable  violence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when  Joe picked her up, was a convictâs leg-iron which had been filed  asunder.",take away house blowing candle stand table door sister stand face fire strike disarrangement kitchen except fall bleeding remarkable piece evidence spot strike blunt heavy head spine blow deal heavy throw considerable violence lie face ground joe pick leg iron file asunder

The hue and cry going off to the  Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joeâs opinion was  corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the  prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they  claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been  worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night.

There was nothing against  him, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with  everybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if  he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no  dispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore  them. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in  so silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could  look round.",orlick go town exactly tell pick turnpike see town evening diver company public house come wopsle save quarrel sister quarrel everybody thousand time strange man come bank note dispute sister fully prepared restore altercation assailant come silently suddenly fell look round

I suffered  unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I  should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the  story.

The  contention came, after all, to this;âthe secret was such an old one  now, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not  tear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much  mischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me  if he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not  believe it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets  as a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of  courseâfor, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing  is always done?âand resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see  any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of  the assailant.",horrible think provide weapon undesignedly hardly think suffer unspeakable trouble consider reconsider dissolve spell childhood tell joe story month day settle question finally negative reopen reargue morning contention come secret old grow tear away addition dread have lead mischief likely alienate joe believe restraining dread believe assort fabulous dog veal cutlet monstrous invention temporize waver right wrong thing resolve disclosure new occasion new chance help discovery assailant

They took up several obviously  wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,  and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead  of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood  about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks  that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a  mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as  taking the culprit.

Dickens,Expectations,"Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay  very ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects  multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of  the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and  her speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as  to be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always  by her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate  in speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than  indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,  extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always  called in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,  the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among  the mildest of my own mistakes.",long constitutional power disperse sister lie ill bed sight disturb see object multiply grasp visionary teacup wineglass instead reality hearing greatly impaired memory speech unintelligible come round far help downstair necessary slate indicate write indicate speech bad handwriting apart indifferent speller joe indifferent reader extraordinary complication arise call solve administration mutton instead medicine substitution tea joe baker bacon mild mistake

A  tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part  of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three  months, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then  remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind.

Dickens,Expectations,"It may have been about a month after my sisterâs reappearance in the  kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the  whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.  Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly  cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had  been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me  every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, âSuch a fine  figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!â Biddy instantly taking the  cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe  became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,  and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that  did him good.

I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,  from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the  sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my  sisterâs ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a  qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one  after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the  shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and  displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence.

It would all come out in  good time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,  save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.  Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work  again, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining  his knees, said, âAy, ay, Iâll be ekervally partickler, Pip;â and then  they congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at  the notion of my being a gentleman that I didnât half like it.",take impress biddy biddy joe grave obligation consider friend know maker fortune come good time observe say save come great expectation mysterious patron biddy nod head thoughtfully fire take work say particular joe detain knee say ay ekervally partickler congratulate go express wonder notion gentleman half like

Dickens,Expectations,"Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an  affectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I  got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a  mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,  for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even  at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind  between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in  so often between the forge and Miss Havishamâs, and Biddy and Estella.",biddy say handsomely forgive soon exchange affectionate good night joe go bed get little room sit take long look mean little room soon part raise furnish fresh young remembrance moment fall confused division mind well room go forge miss biddy estella

For although Mr.  Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented  with it, he said apologetically that it âwouldnât do under existing  circumstances, sir,âwouldnât do at all.â So, Mr. Trabb measured and  calculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest  species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I  felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his  pains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles  to Mr. Pumblechookâs on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand  upon the parlour lock, âI know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be  expected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a  turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem  it.

It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come  into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,  it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention  diverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his  mind upon me.

There were not so many papers  about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd  objects about, that I should not have expected to see,âsuch as an old  rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and  packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly  swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggersâs own high-backed  chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,  like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and  bit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the  clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the  wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggersâs chair, being greasy with  shoulders.

Dickens,Expectations,"I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggersâs  chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I  called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to  everybody elseâs disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many  other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have  the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what  was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came  there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggersâs  family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such  ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the  blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.  Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits  may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and  grit that lay thick on everything.

So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being  all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to  me. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a  street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paulâs bulging at me  from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate  Prison.

This was horrible, and gave me a  sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justiceâs  proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his  pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not  belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had  bought cheap of the executioner.

There were some  marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been  softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.  The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment  over his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them  off. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his  linen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for  he wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a  lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,  that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were  quite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering  eyes,âsmall, keen, and black,âand thin wide mottled lips.

But that he  was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a  gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a  principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever  was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no  varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you  put on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued  Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe  she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the  susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she  passionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized  him. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got  great sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out  of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his  father) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband  he must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in  Miss Havishamâs counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love  to be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with  the exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or  jealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she  was doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too  unreservedly in his power.

I was at a loss to account for  this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to  speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,  which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.  Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby  and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.",wait suppose pocket come rate wait opportunity observe remarkable family phenomenon child stray near pocket play trip tumble momentary astonishment enduring lamentation loss account surprising circumstance help give mind speculation miller come baby baby hand flopson flopson hand pocket go fairly head foremost pocket baby catch herbert

Dickens,Expectations,"Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a  little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had  lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders  that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap.

Dickens,Expectations,"  Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to  see him. âFor, I really am not,â he added, with his sonâs smile, âan  alarming personage.â He was a young-looking man, in spite of his  perplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite  natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;  there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would  have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was  very near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to  Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which  were black and handsome, âBelinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?â  And she looked up from her book, and said, âYes.â She then smiled upon  me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of  orange-flower water?

Dickens,Expectations,"I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.  Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased  Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased  father would have been made a Baronet but for somebodyâs determined  opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,âI forget whose, if  I ever knew,âthe Sovereignâs, the Prime Ministerâs, the Lord  Chancellorâs, the Archbishop of Canterburyâs, anybodyâs,âand had tacked  himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite  supposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for  storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate  address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first  stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage  either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed  Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature  of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the  acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.",find hour mention pocket daughter certain accidental deceased knight invent conviction deceased father baronet determine opposition arise entirely personal motive forget know prime lord archbishop tack noble earth right supposititious fact believe knight storm english grammar point pen desperate address engross vellum occasion laying stone building hand royal personage trowel mortar direct pocket bring cradle nature thing marry title guard acquisition plebeian domestic knowledge
Dickens,Expectations,"So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady  by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but  perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,  in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was  also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to  mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing  the one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket  had taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it  would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the  knowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing  to bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that  dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket  that his wife was âa treasure for a Prince.â Mr. Pocket had invested  the Princeâs treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was  supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.  Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,  because she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of  a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.",successful watch ward establish young lady judicious parent grow highly ornamental perfectly helpless useless character happily form bloom youth encounter pocket bloom youth decide mount woolsack roof mitre mere question time pocket take time forelock judge length want cutting marry knowledge judicious parent judicious parent have bestow withhold blessing handsomely settle dow short struggle inform pocket wife treasure pocket invest treasure way world suppose bring indifferent interest pocket general object queer sort respectful pity marry title pocket object queer sort forgiving reproach get
Dickens,Expectations,"Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a  pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for  my own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other  similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle  and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of  architecture, was whistling.

Dickens,Expectations,"Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody  elseâs hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house  and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the  servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of  saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the  servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their  eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They  allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always  appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded  in would have been the kitchen,âalways supposing the boarder capable of  self-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring lady  with whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that  she had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs.  Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it  was an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldnât mind their own  business.",pocket noticeable air somebody hand wonder possession house let live find unknown power servant smooth way go respect save trouble appearance expensive servant feel duty owe nice eating drinking deal company downstairs allow liberal table pocket appear far good house board kitchen suppose boarder capable self defence week neighbouring lady family personally unacquainted write see miller slap baby greatly distress pocket burst tear receive note say extraordinary thing neighbour mind business
Dickens,Expectations,"By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been  educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished  himself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket  very early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the  calling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,âof whom  it was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always  going to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the  blades had left the Grindstone,âhe had wearied of that poor work and  had come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he  had âreadâ with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,  and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned  his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,  and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still  maintained the house I saw.",degree learn chiefly herbert pocket educate harrow cambridge distinguish happiness marry pocket early life impair prospect take calling grinder grind number dull blade remarkable father influential go help preferment forget blade leave grindstone weary poor work come london gradually fail lofty hope diver lack opportunity neglect refurbish diver special occasion turn acquirement account literary compilation correction mean add moderate private resource maintain house see

This ladyâs name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking her  down to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand  on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.  Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read  with him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and  confidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five  minutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.",pocket toady neighbour widow lady highly sympathetic nature agree everybody bless everybody shed smile tear everybody accord circumstance coiler honour take dinner day installation give understand stair blow dear pocket dear pocket necessity receive gentleman read extend tell gush love confidence time know minute like thing

Dickens,Expectations,"It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and  Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and  other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian  name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It  further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the  garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which  her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at  all. Drummle didnât say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a  sulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.  Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler  the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the  conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but  it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the  announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook  had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first  time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance  that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on  anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He  laid down the carving-knife and fork,âbeing engaged in carving, at the  moment,âput his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make  an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it.

She had a serpentine way of coming close at me  when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and  localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and  when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little  to her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for  being on the opposite side of the table.",coiler change subject begin flatter like moment flatter grossly pleasure soon serpentine way come close pretend vitally interested friend locality leave altogether snaky fork tongue occasional bounce startop say little drummle say envy opposite table

They were brought in by Flopson and  Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been  recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.  Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she  rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but  didnât quite know what to make of them.",dinner child introduce coiler admire comment eye nose leg sagacious way improve mind little girl little boy baby successor bring flopson miller non commission officer recruit child enlist pocket look young nobles ought think pleasure inspect know

Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his  face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,  as if he couldnât make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in  that establishment, and why they hadnât been billeted by Nature on  somebody else.

The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and  talking, until it was almost nine oâclock. âGetting near gun-fire,â  said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; âitâs the Agedâs treat.â",course feel good faith involve observance request punch nice sit drink talk near gun fire say wemmick lay pipe
Dickens,Expectations,"Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,  with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great  nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the  moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and  repair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the  Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a  cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup  in it ring. Upon this, the Agedâwho I believe would have been blown out  of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbowsâcried out exultingly,  âHeâs fired! I heerd him!â and I nodded at the old gentleman until it  is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.",proceed castle find aged heating poker expectant eye preliminary performance great nightly ceremony wemmick stand watch hand moment come red hot poker aged repair battery take go presently stinger go bang shake crazy little box cottage fall piece glass teacup ring believe blow arm chair hold exultingly fire heerd nod old gentleman figure speech declare absolutely
Dickens,Expectations,"The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me  his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious  character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been  committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and  several manuscript confessions written under condemnation,âupon which  Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, âevery  one of âem Lies, sir.â These were agreeably dispersed among small  specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the  proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.  They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had  been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general  sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan  on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the  suspension of a roasting-jack.",interval time supper wemmick devoted show collection curiosity felonious character comprise pen celebrate forgery commit distinguished razor lock hair manuscript confession write condemnation wemmick set particular value use word lies agreeably disperse small specimen china glass neat trifle proprietor museum tobacco stopper carve aged display chamber castle induct serve general sitting room kitchen judge saucepan hob brazen bijou fireplace design suspension roasting jack
Dickens,Expectations,"There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged  in the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered  to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper  was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot  insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have  been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.  Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there  being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when  I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that  pole on my forehead all night.",neat little girl attendance look age day lay supper cloth bridge lower mean egress withdraw night supper excellent castle subject dry rot insomuch taste like bad nut pig far heartily pleased entertainment drawback little turret bedroom thin ceiling flagstaff lie bed balance pole forehead night
Dickens,Expectations,"Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him  cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from  my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a  most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at  half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,  Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened  into a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business  and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as  unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the  drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,  had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the  Stinger.",wemmick early morning afraid hear clean boot fall gardening see gothic window pretend employ aged nod devoted manner breakfast good supper half past precisely start little britain degree wemmick get dryer hard go mouth tighten post office get place business pull key coat collar look unconscious walworth property castle drawbridge arbour lake fountain aged blow space discharge stinger
Dickens,Expectations,"  It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early  opportunity of comparing my guardianâs establishment with that of his  cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with  his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he  called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends  which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. âNo ceremony,â he stipulated,  âand no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.â I asked him where we should  come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his  general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,  âCome here, and Iâll take you home with me.â I embrace this opportunity  of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or  a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,  which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumerâs shop. It had an  unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would  wash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,  whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his  room. When I and my friends repaired to him at six oâclock next day, he  seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than  usual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only  washing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And  even when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,  he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before  he put his coat on.",fall wemmick tell early opportunity compare establishment cashier clerk guardian room wash hand scented soap go office walworth call give invitation friend wemmick prepare receive ceremony stipulate dinner dress ask come idea live believe general objection like admission reply home embrace opportunity remark wash client surgeon dentist closet room fit purpose smell scented soap like shop unusually large jack towel roller inside door wash hand wipe dry towel come police court dismiss client room friend repair day engage case dark complexion usual find head butt closet wash hand lave face gargle throat go round jack towel take penknife scrape case nail coat
Dickens,Expectations,"There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into  the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was  something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his  presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along  westward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of  the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he  never otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody  recognised him.",people slink usual pass street evidently anxious speak conclusive halo scented soap encircle presence give day walk westward recognise face crowd street happen talk louder recognise anybody take notice anybody recognise
Dickens,Expectations,"He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side  of that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in  want of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and  opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and  little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark  brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the  panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know  what kind of loops I thought they looked like.",conduct gerrard street soho house south street stately house kind dolefully want painting dirty window take key open door go stone hall bare gloomy little dark brown staircase series dark brown room floor carve garland panel wall stand give welcome know kind loop think look like
Dickens,Expectations,"Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his  dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the  whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was  comfortably laidâno silver in the service, of courseâand at the side of  his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and  decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed  throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed  everything himself.",dinner lay good room second dressing room bedroom tell hold house rarely see table comfortably silver service chair capacious dumb waiter variety bottle decanter dish fruit dessert notice keep hand distribute
Dickens,Expectations,"There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,  that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,  trials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very  solid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,  and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a  little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring  the office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an  evening and fall to work.",bookcase room see back book evidence criminal law criminal biography trial act parliament thing furniture solid good like watch chain official look merely ornamental see corner little table paper shaded lamp bring office home respect wheel evening fall work

I cannot  say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be  parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious  expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see  Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked  to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had  seen rise out of the Witchesâ caldron.",woman suppose think young tall lithe nimble figure extremely pale large faded eye quantity stream hair diseased affection heart cause lip part pant face bear curious expression suddenness flutter know macbeth theatre night face look disturb fiery air like face see rise caldron

We took our seats  at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,  while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the  housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice  mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all  the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our  host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the  table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean  plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just  disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant  than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw  in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made  a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other  natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass  behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.",set dish touch guardian quietly arm finger notify dinner ready vanish take seat round table guardian keep drummle startop sit noble dish fish housekeeper table joint equally choice mutton equally choice bird sauce wine accessory want good give host dumb waiter circuit table similarly deal clean plate knife fork course drop disuse basket ground chair attendant housekeeper appear set dish see face face rise caldron year dreadful likeness woman cause face natural resemblance derive flow hair pass bowl flame spirit dark room
Dickens,Expectations,"Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own  striking appearance and by Wemmickâs preparation, I observed that  whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my  guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put  before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and  wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say.

Dickens,Expectations,"Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather  than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of  our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing  my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to  boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my  lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the  development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious  way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.",dinner go gayly guardian follow originate subject know wrench weak disposition find express tendency lavish expenditure patronise herbert boast great prospect know open lip drummle development inclination gird grudging suspicious way rest screw fish take

Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to  our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that  as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible  agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity  about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show  how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in  a ridiculous manner.",get cheese conversation turn rowing feat drummle rally come night slow amphibious way drummle inform host prefer room company skill master strength scatter like chaff invisible agency guardian wind pitch little short ferocity trifle fall bare span arm muscular fall bare span arm ridiculous manner

Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeperâs, like a trap,  as she stretched it across the table.

He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop  tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made  us all laugh.

I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a  boy in boots,âtop boots,âin bondage and slavery to whom I might have  been said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of  the refuse of my washerwomanâs family), and had clothed him with a blue  coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots  already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to  eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my  existence.",begin decorate chamber unnecessary inappropriate way expensive wrestle barnard prove time room vastly different find enjoy honour occupy prominent page book neighbouring upholsterer get fast late start boy boot boot bondage slavery say pass day monster refuse family clothe blue coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breech boot mention find little great deal eat horrible requirement haunt existence

Still, the coincidence of our  being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a  dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in  his hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as  soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This  device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot  under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down  before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the  first stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their  way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off  to the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting  for them at the slime-washed stairs,âagain heard the gruff âGive way,  you!â like and order to dogs,âagain saw the wicked Noahâs Ark lying out  on the black water.",overhear dialogue assuredly get leave solitude darkness highway feel certain man suspicion identity change course nature differently dress differently circumstanced likely know accidental help coincidence coach sufficiently strange fill dread coincidence moment connect hearing reason resolve alight soon touch town hearing device execute successfully little portmanteau boot foot turn hinge throw get leave lamp stone town pavement convict go way coach know point spirit river fancy see boat convict crew wait slime wash stair hear gruff way like order dog see wicked ark lie black water

Dickens,Expectations,"She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could  not fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for  me to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark  rooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down  the cobwebs, destroy the vermin,âin short, do all the shining deeds of  the young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to  look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked  windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with  its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich  attractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the  inspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had  taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so  set upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had  been all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her  with any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this  place, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be  followed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the  conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified  truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her  simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my  sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against  reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against  happiness, against all discouragement that could be.

On the other hand, she often  looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his  face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a  dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often  referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,  he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he  extortedâand even did extort, though I donât know howâthose references  out of my innocent self.",equal determined reticence jaggers roof see keep look scarcely direct eye face dinner speak listen course answer look hand look interest curiosity distrust face show consciousness dinner take dry delight make sarah pocket greener yellower refer conversation expectation show consciousness appear extort know reference innocent self

Three or  four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he  saw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his  hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to  take notice that it was of no use, for he couldnât answer.",leave sit air general lie consequence information possess cros examine wine hand hold candle taste port roll mouth swallow look glass smell port try drank fill cross examine glass nervous know wine tell disadvantage time feebly think start conversation see go ask look glass hand roll wine mouth request notice use answer

She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss  Havishamâs room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss  Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels  from her dressing-table into Estellaâs hair, and about her bosom and  arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick  eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,  with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.",think miss pocket conscious sight involve danger goad madness tear cap hideous nature muslin mop strew ground hair assuredly grow head appear go miss room play whist interval miss havisham fantastic way beautiful jewel dressing table hair bosom arm see guardian look thick eyebrow raise little loveliness rich flush glitter colour

I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar  immediately after breakfast.

Iâm so frightened!â feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and  contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance.

Dickens,Expectations,"  On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country  elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The  whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble  boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer  with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in  life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of  white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My  gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could  have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.",arrival denmark find king queen country elevate arm chair kitchen table hold court danish nobility attendance consist noble boy wash leather boot gigantic ancestor venerable peer dirty face rise people late life danish chivalry comb hair pair white silk leg present feminine appearance gifted townsman stand gloomily apart fold arm wish curl forehead probable
Dickens,Expectations,"Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action  proceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been  troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it  with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom  also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had  the appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of  anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were  suggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led  to the Shadeâs being advised by the gallery to âturn over!ââa  recommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted  of this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of  having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it  perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its  terrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom  lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public  to have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem  by a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her  waist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so  that she was openly mentioned as âthe kettle-drum.â The noble boy in  the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were  in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a  clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court  fencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice  discrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a  want of toleration for him, and evenâon his being detected in holy  orders, and declining to perform the funeral serviceâto the general  indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such  slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off  her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who  had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the  front row of the gallery, growled, âNow the babyâs put to bed letâs  have supper!â Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.",curious little circumstance transpire action proceed late king country appear trouble cough time decease take tomb bring royal phantom carry ghostly manuscript round truncheon appearance occasionally refer air anxiety tendency lose place reference suggestive state mortality conceive lead advise gallery recommendation take extremely ill likewise note majestic spirit appear air have long time walk immense distance perceptibly come closely contiguous wall occasion terror receive derisively queen denmark buxom lady doubt historically brazen consider public brass chin attach diadem broad band metal gorgeous toothache waist encircle arm openly mention kettle noble boy ancestral boot inconsistent represent breath able seaman stroll actor grave digger clergyman person utmost importance court fencing match authority practise eye nice discrimination fine stroke judge gradually lead want toleration detect holy order decline perform funeral general indignation take form nut lastly ophelia prey slow musical madness course time take white muslin scarf fold bury sulky man long cool impatient nose iron bar row gallery growl bed keeping
Dickens,Expectations,"Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with  playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or  state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on  the question whether âtwas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared  yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said âToss up for  it;â and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such  fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged  with loud cries of âHear, hear!â When he appeared with his stocking  disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very  neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat  iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness  of his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had  given him. On his taking the recorders,âvery like a little black flute  that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the  door,âhe was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he  recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,  âAnd donât _you_ do it, neither; youâre a deal worse than _him_!â And I  grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of  these occasions.",unfortunate townsman incident accumulate playful effect undecided prince ask question state doubt public help example question nobler mind suffer roar yes incline opinion say debating society arise ask fellow crawl earth heaven encourage loud cry appear stocking disorder disorder express accord usage neat fold suppose get flat iron conversation take place gallery respect paleness leg occasion turn ghost give take recorder like little black flute play orchestra hand door call unanimously rule britannia recommend player saw air sulky man say deal bad grieve add peal laughter greet wopsle occasion
Dickens,Expectations,"But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the  appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical  wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in  a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,  the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, âLook out! Hereâs the  undertaker a coming, to see how youâre a getting on with your work!â I  believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle  could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,  without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;  but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without  the comment, âWai-ter!â The arrival of the body for interment (in an  empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a  general joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the  bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended  Mr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the  orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the  king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles  upward.",great trial churchyard appearance primeval forest kind small ecclesiastical wash house turnpike gate wopsle comprehensive black cloak descry enter turnpike gravedigger admonish friendly way undertaker coming getting believe know constitutional country wopsle possibly return skull moralize dust finger white napkin take breast innocent indispensable action pass comment arrival body interment black box lid tumble open signal general joy enhance discovery bearer individual obnoxious identification joy attend wopsle struggle laerte brink orchestra grave slacken tumble king kitchen table die inch ankle upward

Dickens,Expectations,"Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where  suppliants for Mr. Jaggersâs notice were lingering about as usual, and  I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some  three hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange  it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and  crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter  evening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have  reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded  but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and  advancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful  young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with  absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished  that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone  with him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not  have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust  off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress,  and I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel,  remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and  I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmickâs  conservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand  waving to me.",wemmick part office little britain suppliant notice linger usual return watch street coach office hour hand consume time think strange encompass taint prison crime childhood lonely marsh winter evening encounter reappear occasion start like stain fade go new way pervade fortune advancement mind engage think beautiful young estella proud refined come think absolute abhorrence contrast jail wish wemmick meet yield go day year day newgate breath clothe beat prison dust foot saunter fro shake dress exhale air lung contaminate feel remember come coach come quickly free soil consciousness conservatory see face coach window hand wave

I lived in a state of  chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience was  not by any means comfortable about Biddy.

That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,  and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my  satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the  influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so  I perceivedâthough dimly enough perhapsâthat it was not beneficial to  anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My  lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not  afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace  with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having  unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor  arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,  and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them  slumbering.

At Startopâs suggestion, we put  ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the  Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were  not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to  quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause  six waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying  social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I  understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast  of the society: which ran âGentlemen, may the present promotion of good  feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.â",infallible way make little ease great ease begin contract quantity debt hardly begin herbert begin soon follow suggestion election club call finches grove object institution divine member dine expensively fortnight quarrel possible dinner cause waiter drunk stair know gratifying social end invariably accomplish herbert understand refer standing toast society run present promotion good feel reign predominant finches

Occasionally, he shot himself out of his  equipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion  deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional wayâlike  coals.

In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew  greyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by  the hair.

Dickens,Expectations,"Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look  about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he  consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an  almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I  ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we  undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a  Republic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except  at a certain hour of every afternoon to âgo to Lloydâsââin observance  of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything  else in connection with Lloydâs that I could find out, except come back  again.

When I had got all my responsibilities  down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My  self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.  When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,  docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical  bundle.

I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,  but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have  been an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately,  to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of  freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another  margin.",business habit bright feature call example suppose debt pound twopence margin suppose time leave margin seven high opinion wisdom margin bind acknowledge look deem expensive device run new debt immediately extent margin sense freedom solvency impart get pretty far margin

The figure of my  sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That  the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed  unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my  thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming  towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the  door.

Two dismally  absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a  black bandage,âas if that instrument could possibly communicate any  comfort to anybody,âwere posted at the front door; and in one of them I  recognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young  couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of  intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped  round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and  most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed  windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two  warders (the postboy) knocked at the door,âimplying that I was far too  much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.",come sight house see trabb funereal execution take possession dismally absurd person ostentatiously exhibit crutch black bandage instrument possibly communicate comfort anybody post door recognise postboy discharge boar turn young couple sawpit bridal morning consequence intoxication render necessary ride horse clasp round neck arm child village woman admire sable warder closed window house forge come warder postboy knock door far exhausted grief strength remain knock

At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished  putting somebodyâs hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;  so he held out his hand for mine.

When I had spoken to Biddy, as I  thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and  there began to wonder in what part of the house itâsheâmy sisterâwas.  The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I  looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible  until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum  cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and  biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had  never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.  Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook  in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately  stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my  attention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing  sherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, âMay I, dear sir?â and  did. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent  speechless paroxysm in a corner.

I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in  behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how  we had fought. I glanced at Herbertâs home, and at his character, and  at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;  those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had  derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I  confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might  have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham  in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the  possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the  certainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any  mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told  Wemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a  great affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some  rays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmickâs experience  and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my  resources to help Herbert to some present income,âsay of a hundred a  year, to keep him in good hope and heart,âand gradually to buy him on  to some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to  understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbertâs  knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world  with whom I could advise.

The  responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and  that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me  in some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were  going to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a  hay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as  it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss  Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises  became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to  participate in the entertainment.",little conversation effect return castle find miss skiffins prepare tea responsible duty make toast delegate aged excellent old gentleman intent danger melt eye nominal meal go vigorous reality aged prepare hay stack buttered toast scarcely simmer iron stand hook bar miss skiffin brew jorum tea pig premise strongly excited repeatedly express desire participate entertainment

I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss  Skiffinsâs arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and  I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the  profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very  new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by  Wemmick.",flag strike gun fire right moment time feel snugly cut rest walworth moat thirty foot wide deep disturb tranquillity castle occasional tumbling open john miss skiffins little door prey spasmodic infirmity sympathetically uncomfortable get infer methodical nature miss arrangement tea sunday night suspect classic brooch wear represent profile undesirable female straight nose new moon piece portable property give wemmick

Dickens,Expectations,"The Agedâs reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsleâs  great-auntâs, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come  through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was  always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into  them, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was  equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,  quite unconscious of his many rescues.

Dickens,Expectations,"As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a  shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.  Wemmickâs mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually  stealing his arm round Miss Skiffinsâs waist. In course of time I saw  his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment  Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm  again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest  deliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffinsâs composure  while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever  seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction  of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it  mechanically.",wemmick miss skiffins sit sit shadowy corner observe slow gradual elongation mouth powerfully suggestive slowly gradually steal arm round miss waist course time see hand appear miss skiffins moment miss skiffins neatly stop green glove unwound arm article dress great deliberation lay table miss composure remarkable sight see think act consistent abstraction mind deem miss skiffins perform mechanically
Dickens,Expectations,"By and by, I noticed Wemmickâs arm beginning to disappear again, and  gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to  widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite  enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side  of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness  of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid  it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am  justified in stating that during the whole time of the Agedâs reading,  Wemmickâs arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled  to it by Miss Skiffins.",notice arm begin disappear gradually fade view shortly mouth begin widen interval suspense enthral painful see hand appear miss skiffins instantly miss skiffins stop neatness placid boxer take girdle cestus lay table take table represent path virtue justify state time reading arm stray path virtue recall miss skiffins
Dickens,Expectations,"At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time  for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black  bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical  dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these  appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who  was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and  Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer  to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had  best go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and  having passed a pleasant evening.",aged read light slumber time wemmick produce little kettle tray glass black bottle porcelain top cork represent clerical dignitary rubicund social aspect aid appliance warm drink include aged soon awake miss skiffins mixed observe wemmick drink glass course know well offer miss skiffins home circumstance think good take cordial leave aged have pass pleasant evening
Dickens,Expectations,"Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,  stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter  appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would  be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to  Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by  appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication  with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that  we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long  established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted  capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a  partner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which  Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds  down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at  certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my  property. Miss Skiffinsâs brother conducted the negotiation.

Dickens,Expectations,"The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the  least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the  radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a  mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the  young merchantâs name), and of Clarrikerâs having shown an  extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the  opening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his  face brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate  friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of  triumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and  he having that day entered Clarrikerâs House, and he having talked to  me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really  cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations  had done some good to somebody.",business cleverly manage herbert suspicion hand shall forget radiant face come home afternoon tell mighty piece news have fall clarriker young have show extraordinary inclination belief opening come day day hope grow strong face bright think affectionate friend great difficulty restrain tear triumph see happy length thing have day enter house have talk evening flush pleasure success cry good earnest go bed think expectation good somebody

The mother  looked young, and the daughter looked old; the motherâs complexion was  pink, and the daughterâs was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,  and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good  position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,  if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but  the understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and  that she was necessary to them.

The  nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of  familiarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to my  distraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned  the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a  constant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary,  steward, half-brother, poor relation,âif I had been a younger brother  of her appointed husband,âI could not have seemed to myself further  from my hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her  by her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the  circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely  that it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it  almost maddened me.",house house suffer kind degree torture estella cause nature relation place term familiarity place term favour conduce distraction use tease admirer turn familiarity account put constant slight devotion secretary steward half brother poor relation young brother appoint husband hope near privilege call hear circumstance aggravation trial think likely madden lover know certainly madden

But, when we sat by her flickering fire at  night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estellaâs hand drawn  through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by  dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular  letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;  and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind  mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch  stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a  very spectre.",estella look search glance pry heart probe wound use pip use ask witch like eagerness hearing sit flickering fire night weird keep hand draw arm clutch hand extort dint refer estella tell regular letter name condition man fascinate miss havisham dwelt roll intensity mind mortally hurt diseased sit hand crutch stick chin wan bright eye glare spectre

At last, when the night  was slow to creep on towards two oâclock, I felt that I absolutely  could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I  must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out  across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the  outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no  sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss  Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I  followed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She  carried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from  one of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by  its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed  air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard  her walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again  into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark  both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some  streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During  the whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I  heard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless  low cry.",lie separate building courtyard time lain rest satis house sleep refuse come near thousand miss havishams haunt pillow head bed foot half open door dressing room dressing room room overhead room beneath night slow creep feel absolutely long bear place place lie get clothe go yard long stone passage design gain outer courtyard walk relief mind soon passage extinguish candle see miss havisham go ghostly manner make low cry follow distance see staircase carry bare candle hand probably take sconce room unearthly object light stand staircase feel mildew air feast chamber see open door hear walk room cease low cry time try dark streak day stray show lay hand interval go staircase hear footstep see light pass hear ceaseless low cry

Dickens,Expectations,"  Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made  the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney  chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed  was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the  chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next  in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in  order on his list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the  back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling  over the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the  fireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched  little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.",turn temple gate soon read warning good way fleet street get late hackney chariot drive hummums covent garden time bed get hour night chamberlain let ready wicket light candle order shelf show straight bedroom order list sort vault ground floor despotic monster post bedstead straddle place put arbitrary leg fireplace doorway squeeze wretched little washing stand divinely righteous manner
Dickens,Expectations,"As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,  before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those  virtuous daysâan object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which  instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever  be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the  bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a  staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and  lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more  close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.

Dickens,Expectations,"What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an  inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I  looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a  number of blue-bottle flies from the butchersâ, and earwigs from the  market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying  by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever  tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,âa  disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable  approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those  extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves  audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little  washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the  chest of drawers.

Dickens,Expectations,"Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never  warded off this DONâT GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I  thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had  read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums  in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had  been found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that  he must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to  assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door  to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship  of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But  all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,  and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were  questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed  there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I  thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I  recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and  tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,âeven then I was  pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Donât go home.

At the old lodgings it was understood that he was  summoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and  cornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that  it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself  about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off  and quite otherwise engaged.

Dickens,Expectations,"There was something so natural and winning in Claraâs resigned way of  looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and  something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of  yielding herself to Herbertâs embracing arm; and something so gentle in  her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinksâs Basin,  and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the  beam,âthat I would not have undone the engagement between her and  Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.",natural win resign way look store detail herbert point confiding loving innocent modest manner yield embrace arm gentle need protection mill pond bank basin old green copper rope walk old barley growl beam undo engagement herbert money pocket book open

He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there  was, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a  strong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a  secluded life.

Herbert, coming to my bedside  when he came in,âfor I went straight to bed, dispirited and  fatigued,âmade the same report.

Then, I began to go out as for training and  practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in  cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been  out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the  hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old  London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there  was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But  I knew well enough how to âshootâ the bridge after seeing it done, and  so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to  Erith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were  pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the  blind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less  frequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single  word of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there  was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being  watched.

But  I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more  money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and  plans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,  to hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfactionâwhether  it was a false kind or a true, I hardly knowâin not having profited by  his generosity since his revelation of himself.",worldly affair begin wear gloomy appearance press money creditor begin know want money mean ready money pocket relieve convert easily spare article jewelery cash determined heartless fraud money patron exist state uncertain thought plan send unopened pocket book herbert hold keeping feel kind false kind true hardly have profit generosity revelation

I was aware that  Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the  contrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously  heard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection  with a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey.

He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in  the cloth, and on that property married a young person in  bed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of  Portsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach  to rub their own hands and shake everybody elseâs, and sing âFill,  fill!â A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldnât fill, or  do anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly  stated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed  to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so  effectually done (the Swab family having considerable political  influence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then  it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white  hat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a  gridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down  from behind with the gridiron whom he couldnât confute with what he had  overheard. This led to Mr. Wopsleâs (who had never been heard of  before) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of  great power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all  to go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down  the Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services.

I thought how one link of association  had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,  wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a  chance swift from Estellaâs name to the fingers with their knitting  action, and the attentive eyes.

He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day  for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial  where he couldnât work it himself, sat under counsel, andâevery one  knewâput in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,âa  woman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.  It was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman  in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick  (as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of  jealousy. The murdered woman,âmore a match for the man, certainly, in  point of yearsâwas found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had  been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched  and torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,  there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this  woman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.  Jaggers principally rested his case.

Dickens,Expectations,"âWell, sir!â Wemmick went on; âit happenedâhappened, donât you  see?âthat this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her  apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in  particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully  contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a  bruise or two about her,ânothing for a tramp,âbut the backs of her  hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?  Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of  brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not  have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles  were actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the  fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have  been broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little  spots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made  was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that  she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the  murder, frantically destroyed her child by this manâsome three years  oldâto revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:  âWe say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and  we show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and  you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept  all consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have  destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have  scratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder  of her child; why donât you? As to this case, if you _will_ have  scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted  for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented  them?â âTo sum up, sir,â said Wemmick, âMr. Jaggers was altogether too  many for the jury, and they gave in.â",wemmick go woman artfully dressed time apprehension look slighter particular sleeve remember skilfully contrive arm delicate look bruise tramp back hand lacerate question finger nail jaggers show struggle great lot bramble high face get keep hand bit bramble actually find skin evidence fact bramble question find examination break little shred dress little spot blood bold point attempt set proof jealousy strong suspicion have time murder frantically destroy child year revenge jaggers work way mark finger nail mark bramble bramble mark finger nail set hypothesis destroy child accept consequence hypothesis know destroy child child cling scratch hand try murder child case scratch know account assume sake argument invent sum sir say wemmick jagger altogether jury give

The cathedral  chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried  on avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell  of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the  rooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high  trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was  changed, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.",good light day go pass quiet echo court high street nook ruin old monk refectory garden strong wall press service humble shed stable silent old monk grave cathedral chime sadder remote sound hurry avoid observation swell old organ bear ear like funeral music rook hover grey tower swung bare high tree priory garden place change estella go

I  represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence  from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said  that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted  assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,  and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he  cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,  and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,  whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything  else in the world.

I turned round to do so, and had taken  up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent  shock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in  a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.",begin rain fast see save see turn house stand shelter doorway look night consider lately soon come candle burn come head look wick long turn round take candle hand extinguish violent shock thing comprehend catch strong running noose throw head

Dickens,Expectations,"Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,âwhich at  first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining  quiet,âI learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our  chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had  met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was  gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the  inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His  uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an  hourâs consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who  volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.  Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his  uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he  resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the  Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,  finding neither, went on to Miss Havishamâs, where they lost me.  Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when  I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh  themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.  Among the loungers under the Boarâs archway happened to be Trabbâs  Boy,âtrue to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he  had no business,âand Trabbâs boy had seen me passing from Miss  Havishamâs in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabbâs boy became  their guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by  the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went  along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought  there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provisâs  safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be  mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and  went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,  endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could  hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was  while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I  was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,  and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.",entreating herbert tell come rescue flatly refuse insist remain quiet learn hurry drop letter open chamber come home bring startop meet street way find soon go tone uneasy inconsistency hasty letter leave uneasiness increase instead subsiding quarter consideration set coach office startop volunteer company inquiry coach go find afternoon coach go find uneasiness grow positive alarm obstacle come way resolve follow post chaise startop arrive blue boar fully expect find tiding find go miss lose go hotel doubtless time hear popular local version story refresh guide marsh lounger archway happen boy ancient habit happen business boy see pass miss direction dining place boy guide go sluice house town way marsh avoid go herbert reflect bring genuine serviceable errand tend safety bethink case interruption mischievous leave guide startop edge quarry go steal round house time endeavour ascertain right hear indistinct sound deep rough voice mind busy begin doubt suddenly cry loudly answer cry rush closely follow
Dickens,Expectations,"When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our  immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it  was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such  a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be  fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we  relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the  present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather  light of the matter to Trabbâs boy; who, I am convinced, would have  been much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his  intervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabbâs boy was of a  malignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it  was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybodyâs  expense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed  to meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an  ill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).",tell herbert pass house immediately go magistrate town late night get warrant consider course detain bind come fatal provis gainsay difficulty relinquish thought pursue orlick time present circumstance deem prudent light matter boy convinced affect disappointment know intervention save limekiln boy malignant nature spare vivacity constitution want variety excitement expense part present guinea meet view tell sorry ill opinion impression
Dickens,Expectations,"Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London  that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be  clear away before the nightâs adventure began to be talked of. Herbert  got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this  stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear  its pain on the journey.

Dickens,Expectations,"My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for  to-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of  itself.

Dickens,Expectations,"No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from  communication with him that day; yet this again increased my  restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing  that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me  so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was  something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the  fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days  wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,  my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow  morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning  head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to  high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew  in prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a  fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to  myself with a start, âNow it has come, and I am turning delirious!â",precaution obvious refrain communication day increase restlessness start footstep sound believe discover take messenger tell persuade know take mind fear presentiment fact occur mysterious knowledge day wear ill news come day close darkness fall overshadow dread disable illness morrow morning altogether master burn arm throb burning head throbbed fancy begin wander count high number sure repeat passage know prose verse happen mere escape fatigued mind doze moment forgot start come turn

Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the  notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and  the opportunity to save him was gone.

Dickens,Expectations,"Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking  lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a  marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was  spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there  at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the  clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the  unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn  from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.

We  had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly  possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the  bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were  questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for  it was wholly set on Provisâs safety.

Of course, I had  taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After  a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two  or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went  on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering.

Dickens,Expectations,"Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being  with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,  and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long  reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is  broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and  where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we  could choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all  night. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would  start from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at  what time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail  the first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we  should have another chance.

Dickens,Expectations,"The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was  so great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in  which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the  movement on the river, and the moving river itself,âthe road that ran  with us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us  on,âfreshened me with new hope.

Dickens,Expectations,"At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present  extent, and watermenâs boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing  colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but  of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so  many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and  there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;  the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a  much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and  we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.",time steam traffic thames far present extent boat far numerous barge sailing collier coasting trader steam ship great small tithe twentieth early plenty sculler go morning plenty barge drop tide navigation river bridge open boat easy commoner matter day go ahead skiff wherry briskly

Dickens,Expectations,"The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the  sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose  none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By  imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of  the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the  muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.  As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a  boat or twoâs length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch  the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a  large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And  soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,  and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking  advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us  in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of  the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and  mudbanks.",air feel cold river bright day sunshine cheering tide run strong take care lose steady stroke carry thoroughly imperceptible degree tide run lose nearer wood hill drop lower low muddy bank tide gravesend charge wrap cloak purposely pass boat length float custom house catch stream alongside emigrant ship bow large transport troop forecastle look soon tide begin slacken craft lie anchor swing presently swung round ship take advantage new tide pool begin crowd fleet keep shore strength tide stand carefully low shallow mudbank

It  was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim  horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great  floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed  stranded and still.

By that time the river had lifted us a  little, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on  the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into  black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were  the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,  save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.",push way hard work herbert startop persevered row row row sun go time river lift little bank red sun low level shore purple haze fast deepen black solitary flat marsh far away rise ground life save foreground melancholy gull

So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for  anything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or  five dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with  her galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.  The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and  what light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as  the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.",night fast fall moon past rise early hold little council short clearly course lie lonely tavern find ply oar look like house hold speak little dull mile cold collier come galley fire smoking flaring look like comfortable home night dark time morning light come river sky oar dipping strike reflected star

As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular  intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or  other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and  there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little  creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them  nervously. Sometimes, âWhat was that ripple?â one of us would say in a  low voice. Or another, âIs that a boat yonder?â And afterwards we would  fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with  what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.",dismal time evidently possess idea follow tide flap heavily irregular interval shore sound come sure start look direction set current wear bank little creek suspicious place eye nervously low voice boat fall dead silence sit impatiently think unusual noise oar work thowel

Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light  to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I  dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good  fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various  liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,ââsuch as  they were,â the landlord said.

The dismal wind  was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and  I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened.

When I had induced  Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop  by this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.  Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamerâs time,  which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off  early in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we  deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour  or so of the steamerâs time, and then to get out in her track, and  drift easily with the tide.

It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,  as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw  two men looking into her.

Again our  charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the  men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no  thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,âas, indeed,  it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away  together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take  us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about  noon.

Dickens,Expectations,"He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me  on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in  danger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As  we approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,  while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had  passed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no  boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were  there any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the  tide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.",smoke pipe go stop clap shoulder suppose danger reassure speak little approach point beg remain sheltered place go reconnoitre man pass night comply go boat point boat draw near sign man have embark sure tide high footprint water
Dickens,Expectations,"When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I  waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;  sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving  about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got  aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that  time it wanted but ten minutes of one oâclock, and we began to look out  for her smoke.",look shelter distance see wave hat come rejoin wait lie bank wrap coat move warm see boat come round get aboard easily row track steamer time want minute begin look smoke
Dickens,Expectations,"But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards  we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on  at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of  saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands  cordially, and neither Herbertâs eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I  saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way  ahead of us, and row out into the same track.",half past see smoke soon see smoke steamer come speed get bag ready take opportunity say good bye herbert startop shake hand cordially eye dry see oare galley shoot bank little way ahead row track
Dickens,Expectations,"A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamerâs smoke,  by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,  coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the  tide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to  sit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, âTrust to  me, dear boy,â and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was  very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and  fallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,  she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or  two when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and  looked at us attentively,âas did all the rowers; the other sitter was  wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some  instruction to the steerer as he looked at us.

Dickens,Expectations,"Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,  and gave me the word âHamburg,â in a low voice, as we sat face to face.  She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew  louder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,  when the galley hailed us. I answered.",startop minute steamer give word low voice sit face face near fast beating peddle grow louder louder feel shadow absolutely galley hail answer
Dickens,Expectations,"âYou have a returned Transport there,â said the man who held the lines.  âThatâs the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,  otherwise Provis.

Dickens,Expectations,"At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,  he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke  ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on  to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great  confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and  heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but  felt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw  the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisonerâs shoulder,  and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,  and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite  frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,  lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the  shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that  the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.  Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white  terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board  the steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink  from under me.",moment give audible direction crew run galley abroad pull sudden stroke ahead get oar run athwart hold gunwale know cause great confusion board steamer hear call hear order give stop paddle hear stop feel drive irresistibly moment see steersman galley lie hand shoulder see boat swinge round force tide see hand board steamer run forward frantically moment see prisoner start lean captor pull cloak neck shrink sitter galley moment see face disclose face convict long ago moment see face tilt backward white terror shall forget hear great cry board steamer loud splash water feel boat sink

Dickens,Expectations,"What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of  her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first  distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the  galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong  strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and  eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,  bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up  his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and  true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,  but not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled  at the wrists and ankles.",cry aboard steamer furious blowing steam drive driving distinguish sky water shore shore crew galley right great speed pull certain swift strong stroke ahead lie oar man look silently eagerly water astern presently dark object see bear tide man speak steersman hold hand softly back water keep boat straight true come near see magwitch swimming swim freely take board instantly manacle wrist ankle
Dickens,Expectations,"The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water  was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not  understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had  been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and  we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water.

The injury to  his chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought  he had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did  not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,  but that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify  him, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had  both gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him  (Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him  in it, had capsized us.

Dickens,Expectations,"  He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been  immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down  for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,  to speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had  meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened  that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could  give the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his  private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and  Mr. Jaggers on the prisonerâs behalf would admit nothing. It was the  sole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five  minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could  prevent its going against us.",take police court day immediately commit trial necessary send old officer prison ship escape speak identity doubt compeyson mean depose tumble tide dead happen time prison officer london require evidence go direct jaggers private house arrival night retain assistance jagger behalf admit sole resource tell case minute witness power earth prevent go

But he did not conceal  from me that, although there might be many cases in which the  forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this  case to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not  related to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;  he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his  apprehension, and to do so now would be idle.

When his body was found, many  miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he  was only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still  legible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a  banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the  designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of  information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.  Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit.

Dickens,Expectations,"I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;  while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a babyâs, made a  feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of  giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the  clergymanâs being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.  When he said, âWho giveth this woman to be married to this man?â the  old gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we  had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.  Upon which, the clergyman said again, âWHO giveth this woman to be  married to this man?â The old gentleman being still in a state of most  estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed  voice, âNow Aged P. you know; who giveth?â To which the Aged replied  with great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, âAll right, John,  all right, my boy!â And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon  it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely  married that day.",act capacity backer good man bridegroom little limp pew opener soft bonnet like feint bosom friend miss skiffins responsibility give lady away devolve aged lead unintentionally scandalise happen say giveth woman married old gentleman know point ceremony arrive stand amiably beam commandment clergyman say giveth woman married old gentleman state estimable unconsciousness bridegroom cry accustomed voice aged know aged reply great briskness say give right john right clergyman come gloomy pause doubt moment completely marry day

He had broken  two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great  pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his  hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke  very little.

Dickens,Expectations,"At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible  experience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing  of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of  Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds  before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that  I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that  sentence together.

Dickens,Expectations,"The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,  down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering  in the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside  it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and  women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and  weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There  had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been  stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains  and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great  gallery full of people,âa large theatrical audience,âlooked on, as the  two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge  addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must  single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had  been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments  and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of  years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had  made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable  man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when  far removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a  peaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those  propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered  him a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and  repentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.  Being here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading  the officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of  flight, he had resisted them, and hadâhe best knew whether by express  design, or in the blindness of his hardihoodâcaused the death of his  denouncer, to whom his whole career was known.

Dickens,Expectations,"The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the  glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of  light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,  and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,  with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all  things, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face  in this way of light, the prisoner said, âMy Lord, I have received my  sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,â and sat down  again. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had  to say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of  them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard  look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three  shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had  taken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of  having to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held  my hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got  up (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),  and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him  and me.",sun strike great window court glitter drop rain glass broad shaft light thirty judge link remind audience pass absolute equality great judgment knoweth thing err rise moment distinct speck face way light prisoner say lord receive sentence death almighty bow sit hushing judge go rest formally doom support saunter haggard look bravery nod gallery shake hand go chew fragment herb take sweet herb lie go have help chair slowly hold hand remove audience get put dress right church point criminal
Dickens,Expectations,"I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorderâs  Report was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that  night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting  forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my  sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I  had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men  in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the  Crown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took  no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed  in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away  from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful  and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable  restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,  wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.  To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,  dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and  their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.",earnestly hope pray die report dread linger begin night write petition home secretary state set forth knowledge come sake write fervently pathetically finish send write petition man authority hope merciful draw crown day night sentence take rest fall asleep chair wholly absorb appeal send away place feel hopeful desperate near unreasonable restlessness pain mind roam street evening wander office house leave petition present hour weary western street london cold dusty spring night range stern shut mansion long row lamp melancholy association

Nobody was hard with him or with me. There  was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly.

I ought  rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and  concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth  beyond the fact that I was falling very ill.

At my own  writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,  Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the  pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his  sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was  necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,  and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;  and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might  have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen  spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on  the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into  space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was  tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he  got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had  removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with  his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the  effect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,  with unbounded satisfaction.",evidently biddy teach joe write lie bed look weak state cry pleasure pride set letter bedstead divest curtain remove sitting room airy large carpet take away room keep fresh wholesome night day writing table push corner cumber little bottle joe sit great work choose pen pen tray chest large tool tuck sleeve go wield crow bar sledgehammer necessary joe hold heavily table left elbow right leg begin begin downstroke slowly foot long upstroke hear pen splutter extensively curious idea inkstand constantly dip pen space satisfied result occasionally trip orthographical stumbling block get sign remove finish blot paper crown head forefinger get hover table try effect performance point view lie unbounded satisfaction

Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's  fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one  coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept  the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the  clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted  that it would be necessary for them to part.

The cold became intense. In the main street, at the  corner of the court, some labourers were repairing  the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,  round which a party of ragged men and boys were  gathered: warming their hands and winking their  eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug  being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,  and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness  of the shops where holly sprigs and berries  crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale  faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'  trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,  with which it was next to impossible to believe that  such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything  to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the  mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks  and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's  household should; and even the little tailor, whom he  had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for  being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up  to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean  wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.",fog darkness thicken people run flare link proffer service horse carriage conduct way ancient tower church gruff old bell peep slily scrooge gothic window wall invisible strike hour quarter cloud tremulous vibration tooth chatter frozen head cold intense main street corner court labourer repair gas pipe light great fire brazier round party ragged man boy gather warm hand wink eye blaze rapture water plug leave solitude overflowing sullenly congeal turn misanthropic ice brightness shop holly sprig berry crackle lamp heat window pale face ruddy pass poulterer grocer trade splendid joke glorious pageant impossible believe dull principle bargain sale lord mayor stronghold mighty mansion house give order cook butler christmas lord mayor household little tailor fine shilling previous monday drunk bloodthirsty street stir morrow pudding garret lean wife baby sally buy beef

They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a  lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so  little business to be, that one could scarcely help  fancying it must have run there when it was a young  house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,  and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough  now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but  Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.

The  hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;  and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly  motionless.

There was plenty of width for that, and room  to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge  thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before  him in the gloom.

There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;  Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending  through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,  Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,  hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;  and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came  like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the  whole.

Every one of them wore chains like Marley's  Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)  were linked together; none were free. Many had  been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He  had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white  waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to  its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist  a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,  upon a door-step.

Dickens,Carol,"The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,  and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub  the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he  could see anything; and could see very little then. All he  could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely  cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,  and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been  if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the  world.

Dickens,Carol,"It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a  child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural  medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded  from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.  Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was  white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in  it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were  very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold  were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately  formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic  of the purest white; and round its waist was bound  a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held  a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular  contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed  with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,  that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear  jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was  doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a  great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.",strange figure like child like child like old man view supernatural medium give appearance have recede view diminish child proportion hair hang neck white age face wrinkle tender bloom skin arm long muscular hand hold uncommon strength leg foot delicately form like upper member bare wear tunic pure white round waist bind lustrous belt sheen beautiful hold branch fresh green holly hand singular contradiction wintry emblem dress trim summer flower strange thing crown head spring bright clear jet light visible doubtless occasion duller moment great extinguisher cap hold arm
Dickens,Carol,"Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing  steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt  sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,  and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so  the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a  thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,  now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a  body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible  in the dense gloom wherein they melted away.

It was a large house, but one of broken  fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls  were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their  gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;  and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.  Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for  entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open  doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,  cold, and vast.

Near to the winter  fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge  believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely  matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this  room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children  there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;  and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not  forty children conducting themselves like one, but every  child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences  were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;  on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,  and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to  mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands  most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of  them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no!

All this time, he lay  upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy  light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the  hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than  a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it  meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive  that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of  spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of  knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you or  I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not  in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done  in it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I  say, he began to think that the source and secret of this  ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,  on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.

Heaped up on the floor, to form  a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,  great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,  mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,  cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,  immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that  made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.

So did the room,  the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood  in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the  weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and  not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the  pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of  their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see  it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting  into artificial little snow-storms.",holly mistletoe red berry ivy turkey geese game poultry brawn meat pig sausage oyster pie pudding fruit punch vanish instantly room fire ruddy glow hour night stand city street christmas morning weather severe people rough brisk unpleasant kind music scrape snow pavement dwelling top house mad delight boy come plump road splitting artificial little snow storm
Dickens,Carol,"The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows  blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow  upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;  which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by  the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed  and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great  streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace  in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,  and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,  half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended  in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great  Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away  to their dear hearts' content.

Dickens,Carol,"For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops  were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another  from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious  snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--  laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it  went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the  fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,  pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats  of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out  into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were  ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in  the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking  from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went  by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were  pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there  were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence  to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might  water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy  and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among  the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered  leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting  off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great  compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and  beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after  dinner.

Nor was it that the figs  were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in  modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that  everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but  the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful  promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other  at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left  their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to  fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in  the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people  were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which  they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,  worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws  to peck at if they chose.",grocers oh grocers nearly closed shutter gap glimpse scale descend counter merry sound twine roller part company briskly canister rattle like juggle trick blend scent tea coffee grateful nose raisin plentiful rare almond extremely white stick cinnamon long straight spice delicious candy fruit cake spot molten sugar cold looker feel faint subsequently bilious fig moist pulpy french plum blush modest tartness highly decorate box good eat christmas dress customer hurried eager hopeful promise day tumble door crash wicker basket wildly leave purchase counter come run fetch commit hundred like mistake good humour possible grocer people frank fresh polished heart fasten apron wear outside general inspection christmas daw peck choose

An old, old man and woman, with their  children and their children's children, and another generation  beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.  The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling  of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a  Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a  boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.

And every man on board, waking or  sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another  on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared  to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those  he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted  to remember him.",ghost speed black heaving sea far away tell scrooge shore light ship stand helmsman wheel look bow officer watch dark ghostly figure station man hum christmas tune christmas thought speak breath companion bygone christmas day homeward hope belong man board wake sleep good bad kind word day day year share extent festivity remember care distance know delight remember

Dickens,Carol,"After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical  family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a  Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who  could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never  swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face  over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and  played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:  you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had  been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the  boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of  Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the  things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he  softened more and more; and thought that if he could have  listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the  kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,  without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob  Marley.",tea music musical family know sing glee catch assure especially topper growl away bass like good swell large vein forehead red face scrooge niece play harp play tune simple little air mere learn whistle minute familiar child fetch scrooge boarding school remind ghost christmas past strain music sound thing ghost show come mind soften think listen year ago cultivate kindness life happiness hand resort sexton spade bury jacob marley
Dickens,Carol,"But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After  a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children  sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its  mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first  a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I  no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he  had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done  thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the  Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after  that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the  credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,  tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,  smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,  there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.  He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up  against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would  have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would  have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly  have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.  She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.  But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her  silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got  her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his  conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to  know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her  head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by  pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain  about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told  him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in  office, they were so very confidential together, behind the  curtains.",devote evening music play forfeit good child well christmas mighty founder child stop game blind man buff course believe topper blind believe eye boot opinion thing scrooge nephew ghost christmas present know way go plump sister lace tucker outrage credulity human nature knock fire iron tumble chair bump piano smother curtain go go know plump sister catch anybody fall purpose feint endeavour seize affront understanding instantly sidle direction plump sister cry fair catch spite silken rustling rapid fluttering past get corner escape conduct execrable pretend know pretend necessary touch head dress assure identity press certain ring finger certain chain neck vile monstrous doubt tell opinion blind man office confidential curtain

But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her  love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.  Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was  very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat  her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper  could have told you. There might have been twenty people there,  young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for  wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that  his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with  his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;  for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut  in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in  his head to be.",scrooge niece blind man buff party comfortable large chair footstool snug corner ghost scrooge close join forfeit love love admiration letter alphabet likewise game great secret joy scrooge nephew beat sister hollow sharp girl topper tell people young old play scrooge wholly forget interest go voice sound ear come guess loud guess right sharp needle good whitechapel warrant cut eye sharp scrooge blunt take head
